[{"body": "PARIS  Al Qaedas branch in Yemen formally claimed responsibility on Wednesday for the  at the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo that killed 12 people, saying that the target was chosen by the Qaeda leadership and referring to the attackers as two heroes of Islam.If the claim of direct responsibility holds up, it would make the attacks in France the most deadly strike planned and financed by Al Qaeda on Western soil since the  that killed 52 people. And it would serve as a reminder of the continued danger from the group at a time when much of the attention of Europe and the United States has shifted to the Islamic State, the militant organization that controls large swathes of Syria and Iraq and has become notorious for beheading hostages.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the United States said it had determined that the video clip making the claim of responsibility was genuine, but added that it had not reached a conclusion on whether or not the claims being made in the video are valid.Along with the video from , which featured one of the groups leaders, a statement was sent to reporters, bearing the insignia of the groups publication arm, Al Malahem Media.The newspaper attack began three days of bloodshed that killed five more people and were immediately labeled Frances equivalent of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.The statement indicated that the attack on Charlie Hebdo was in response to the publications frequent caricatures lampooning the Prophet Muhammad.The Qaeda statement said that the one who chose the target, laid the plan and financed the operation is the leadership of the organization.The statement and video both said that the American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki made the arrangement with those who carried out the attack in Paris. It said that Mr. Awlaki, who joined the Qaeda branch in Yemen before being  in September 2011, threatens the West both in his life and after his martyrdom, a reference to the continuing influence on the Internet of his calls for violent jihad.Two brothers, Said and Cherif Kouachi, both French citizens, were accused of the assault on Charlie Hebdo, and  that they were acting on behalf of the Qaeda branch. A day later, a third gunman, identified as Amedy Coulibaly, attacked a police officer and the next day . All  were shot to death by the police in separate but nearly simultaneous operations on Friday.Intelligence and security services in Europe and the United States have been trying to piece together the movements of the Kouachis in recent years and determine the extent of their ties to Al Qaeda. After initially determining that Said Kouachi, the older of the two brothers, had traveled to Yemen in 2011 for training by the Qaeda branch, American counterterrorism officials now believe theres a strong possibility that Cherif Kouachi traveled to Yemen in 2011  probably summer  but used his brother Saids passport, one United States official said.If this is correct, it would have been Cherif Kouachi who received the training from the Qaeda branch there, not Said Kouachi. Cherif Kouachi would have traveled to Yemen through Oman, and would have met or been in contact with Mr. Awlaki while in Yemen. Before returning to France, Cherif was given $20,000 by the Qaeda affiliate to help finance whatever operations he carried out, American counterterrorism officials said.But the American official said intelligence and law enforcement agencies are still seeking more definitive evidence about the travels of the Kouachis. It is still unclear what specific guidance the Qaeda branch in Yemen gave to the Kouachis about carrying out an attack, though it is believed that the satirical magazine was one of the targets discussed, the official said. And the United States has little concrete evidence yet about any travels by the brothers after 2011 or possible further contact with terrorist groups.The Qaeda statement also claimed that the attack was ordered by the groups leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, in keeping with the wishes of his predecessor, Osama bin Laden. However, United States officials were skeptical that Mr. Zawahri personally ordered the attack.Also, there was no explanation why the group waited a week to claim responsibility for a spectacular attack that terrorized and galvanized all of France and much of the world.But it can take days to get approval from leaders of the organization and additional time to produce the videos and documents supporting the claim.Peter Neumann, an expert on terrorism at Kings College in London, said he believed that the Qaeda claim was credible.It makes sense in terms of what attackers themselves said, their background and also the professionalism of the operation itself, he said by email.An English version of the claim, distributed online, showed a chilling image of the Eiffel Tower in Paris seeming to dissolve into a wisp of smoke. The headline reads, Vengeance for the Prophet: A Message Regarding the Blessed Battle of Paris.The statement said the attack on Charlie Hebdo was in retaliation for the mocking depictions of Muhammad. Most Muslims believe any depictions of the prophet are blasphemous.The attacks appear to reflect what analysts have described as an evolution in Qaeda tactics and logistics. Because of heightened surveillance, operatives are trained and assigned general targets, but details on how to carry out the operation are no longer micromanaged by the organization.The looser command structure reduces communication, and thus reduces the chance of intercepts by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.In repeated statements before they were killed by the police, the Kouachi brothers said they had carried out the attack on behalf of the Qaeda branch in Yemen, saying it was in part to avenge the death of Mr. Awlaki. Cherif Kouachi told French television before his death that Mr. Awlaki had given him financial assistance.The statement did not explain why, if the arrangements for the attack were made by Mr. Awlaki, the brothers waited to carry out the assault until more than three years after his death.The statement referred to heroes of lone jihad, an apparent reference to militants acting in small groups or alone, such as with the attacks in France, which has been a growing concern among European counterterrorism authorities.The statement by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula called the Kouachi brothers two heroes of Islam, but it referred to the actions of their accomplice, Mr. Coulibaly, as a coincidence and did not take responsibility for them. , Mr. Coulibaly said he was a supporter of the Islamic State, a rival of Al Qaedas.The Qaeda statement referred to Mr. Coulibaly as a mujahid brother.A member of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity, said the joint timing of the two operations was a result of the friendship between Mr. Coulibaly and the Kouachi brothers and not a reflection of common planning between the Qaeda group and the Islamic State.On Wednesday, news reports in Belgium said that police officers in Charleroi had arrested a man who is believed to have sold weapons to Mr. Coulibaly. Le Soir, a prominent Belgian newspaper, said that the man, who was not identified, surrendered at a police station and told police officers that he had been in contact recently with Mr. Coulibaly because Mr. Coulibaly wanted to buy a car from him. The report said investigators had searched the mans house and found documents involving a negotiation related to arms.Scholars studying the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda said the time that elapsed between the carnage in Paris a week ago and the claim of responsibility on Wednesday was quick in terms of the normal turnaround after previous attacks. Communication is believed to be via couriers, who have to traverse hundreds of miles of desert roads in a rugged quadrant of Yemen to pass messages between officials, who in turn need to sign off on statements before they can be posted.Issuing a claim of responsibility for an operation is not something that is done lightly or spur of the moment, said J.M. Berger, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.But the big question that investigators need to look at is how much of a role did A.Q.A.P. play in the actual planning in the final stages of this process? Mr. Berger said. They could have given these guys money and training three or four years ago, but when they executed it, it could have been done with money from other sources, he said.Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said one remaining unknown was whether one or both of the brothers had contact with Al Qaeda or other militant groups since 2011.In this case both the Kouachis and A.Q.A.P. insist that A.Q.A.P. financed this operation, trained the brothers for it and formulated the target, he said, using the acronym for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Rather than being suggestive of a sleeper cell that sat and waited for three years, some subsequent contact seems likeliest although at this point not definitely proven.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "ERIC SCHMITT", "title": "Claiming Paris Massacre as Its Own, Al Qaeda Seizes Spotlight - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/world/europe/al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula-charlie-hebdo.html", "date": "JAN. 14, 2015"},

The six crew members are safe,  said.There is no data to suggest there was in fact a real ammonia leak, Rob Navias, a commentator, said on NASA Television.Experts at mission control at the Johnson Space Center in Houston were evaluating data, but the problem appeared more likely to have been caused by a sensor problem than an actual leak.Everything is looking pretty normal right now, James Kelly, an astronaut at mission control, told Barry Wilmore, the station commander, in an update after 8 a.m. Eastern. Its a little more positive than we thought before.An alarm woke the crew around 4 a.m. when pressure increased in one of two water loops in the space stations cooling system, NASA said. Then air pressure in the cabin also rose, which could be a sign of an ammonia leak into the American segment of the space station. Ammonia, which is poisonous when inhaled, is used as a coolant.The space station consists of two essentially independent segments, one built by Russia, the other by the United States and other nations.The astronauts put on gas masks, moved into the Russian segment and closed the hatch.Nonessential systems were turned off to avoid the possibility of overheating but were later gradually restarted.

{"body": "Gov. Chris Christie is preparing to take his first concrete steps toward a presidential campaign, with plans to set up a political action committee as early as the end of January that could help finance political travel and provide a fund-raising vehicle for would-be donors.But amid the aggressive, elbows-out jockeying between his likely rivals Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, Mr. Christie, one of the most mercurial and impulsive figures in American politics, has delivered a surprising message to his top supporters and donors: Relax.The governor and his team say that there is more than enough political money should Mr. Christie make a formal announcement in the spring.After several years as a likely presidential candidate, a relatively recent re-election campaign and a successful tenure as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, Mr. Christie already has the rudiments of a national campaign structure. And rather than push the partys top donors to commit quickly to Mr. Bush or Mr. Romney, they say, the rapid expansion of the field  which includes former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas  has left many inclined to take their time.The feedback Ive gotten from a lot of donors is that Mitts announcement created excitement, and so did Huckabees announcement, and now that everyone is back from the holidays, its creating kind of a pause among a lot of donors, said Ray Washburne, the departing finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, who has been tapped to lead fund-raising for a Christie campaign. Why rush?Mr. Christies quiet steps are taking place against a backdrop of bluffs and frenzied showmanship by the many would-be candidates in 2016, much of it prompted by Mr. Bushs plunge into the race last week. The list of likely contenders has grown to more than 20 Republicans from almost every region and of almost every ideological flavor, leaking to a hungry news media the details of seemingly every staff hiring, donor meeting and private phone call.But Christie supporters say that Mr. Bush and Mr. Romney are under more pressure than the New Jersey governor to show momentum. Mr. Romney was telling donors and former staff members as late as October that he would not run unless the other candidates failed to catch fire, meaning many of his loyalists were in the process of lining up behind other candidates before his surprise pronouncement last week. Backers of Mr. Bush, who has been out of elected office for a decade, have made it clear that they hope to scare other candidates out of the race by mustering prohibitive financial and institutional party support.During a trip to New York last week, Mr. Bush held 14 meet-and-greet events in three days, according to a person who saw his schedule, including meetings at KKR, a top private equity company, and Perella Weinberg, an asset management firm.Even so, Mr. Bush hasnt scooped up people yet in a significant way, said one top Republican donor on Wall Street, who has ties to Mr. Bush and Mr. Romney but has committed to neither. What hes doing is what Mitt does  hes rolling into town, having meetings without asking for money.Likewise, Mr. Romneys recent visits to New York did not yield firm commitments from many of the areas top Republicans, such as Woody Johnson, the owner of the Jets, or Paul Singer, the billionaire hedge fund manager.Mr. Christies supporters believe that there is plenty of time to woo them, and that many donors will spread their bets even after fund-raising begins in earnest  an assumption that will be sorely tested in the coming weeks as Mr. Bush and Mr. Romney pressure donors and bundlers to commit.Mr. Christies supporters also view Mr. Romneys entry into the race as poorly handled, even desperate, encouraged by his wife, Ann, and by advisers who made millions of dollars off Mr. Romneys last campaign.Details of a Romney meeting in New York City on Friday were leaked to the news media within hours, along with Mr. Romneys declaration to the guests that he was now considering a third run for the presidency. Some of those invited, who had been told that Mr. Romney merely wanted to catch up with old friends, were blindsided, according to people who attended or were briefed later on the gathering, and resented the implication that they were on board.Two of the attendees, Patrick Durkin, a banker at Barclays, and Alexander Navab, a senior executive at KKR, had already pledged their support to Mr. Bush.Mr. Christie, for his part, had long ago promised fellow Republican governors that he would not allow his presidential ambitions to overshadow his duties as chairman of the governors association. The new PAC is not scheduled to begin operations until after the final inauguration that Mr. Christie has committed to attending  the swearing-in next Wednesday of Larry Hogan of Maryland, one of the surprise Republican victors in last falls midterm elections. The PAC will probably be overseen by Phil Cox, a well-regarded political strategist who served as executive director of the governors association and recently formed his own political consulting firm.Mr. Christies top political adviser, Michael DuHaime, declined to comment.Instead of a frontal assault, the New Jersey governor has been appending largely private sit-downs with donors and other potential supporters onto his schedule of inaugurations  including those on his rivals turf. After attending the inauguration of Gov. Rick Scott of Florida last week, Mr. Christie traveled to Boston, where he attended both the swearing-in of the new Republican governor of Massachusetts and a private round-table event hosted by Seth Klarman, a prominent Republican donor.His approach is, I elected you, and with the folks that he did R.G.A. dinners with in those markets, its, lets talk about the next step,' said one Christie supporter involved in the events.Next week, Kenneth G. Langone, a founder of Home Depot, who is regarded as Mr. Christies foremost cheerleader in New Yorks business community, will host a dinner for the governor with prospective donors. Mr. Langone said in a recent interview that he welcomed the entry into the race of Mr. Bush and Mr. Romney, arguing that it would raise the quality of the Republican field.If we had all those guys run, we wouldnt have a circus like we had in 2011, Mr. Langone said. This is going to be healthy for the Republican Party and bring out a lot of Republican voters.A few days after Mr. Langones event, Mr. Christie will attend the Iowa Freedom Summit, co-hosted by Representative Steve King, a Republican popular with the states grass roots who also has a national profile among Tea Party adherents. That event will serve as the soft launch to the exploratory phase of Mr. Christies campaign, supporters said.The PAC will provide a destination for donors eager to get behind Mr. Christie and a payroll that will allow him to retain potential senior staff members for a presidential campaign. Mr. Bush has already established such a leadership PAC, Right to Rise, which shares its name with a new super PAC that has already begun soliciting contributions.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "NICHOLAS CONFESSORE", "title": "As 2016 Race Gains Steam, Christie Sees No Need to Rush - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/us/politics/as-2016-race-gains-steam-christie-sees-no-need-to-rush.html", "date": "JAN. 14, 2015"},
{"body": "The typical origin story for a tech company includes a paper napkin and a garage. But the company that powers the bike-sharing programs in New York, London, Chicago and a dozen other cities started much differently: It began with a municipal parking authority, wound through bankruptcy court and got another shot at corporate viability off the Madagascar coast during the annual hatching of the green sea turtles.Observing that ritual last year with a group of scientists, Bruno Rodi, a Canadian real estate developer, saw firsthand how those endangered reptiles are threatened by climate change, pollution and hunters. When you go in extreme areas on the planet, you can vividly see that were really destroying the planet, Mr. Rodi recalled. A globe-trotting adventurer, he has climbed the highest mountain on every continent, visited the North and South Poles and rowed more than 5,000 miles across the Indian Ocean. I started to get conscious about this, he said.The turtles  and their precarious existence  set off a burst of environmental entrepreneurialism in Mr. Rodi.Aboard a ship on the Indian Ocean, he heard that the bike-sharing company, which is now known as , was available for purchase. From a satellite phone, he bid about $4 million in cash to buy the company out of bankruptcy. He did this without hiring lawyers and accountants to scour the books.Im not very rich, but Im not a poor person, said Mr. Rodi, a multimillionaire who also owns a Canadian furniture company and whose name is synonymous with sofas in Quebec. So when this came on the market I said, Well, thats interesting.' He quickly learned why due diligence matters.The core of the international business was sound, even profitable by Mr. Rodis assertion, although he would not go into the financial specifics of the private company. As Mr. Rodi likes to say, it is the Rolls-Royce of bike-share systems, with sturdy equipment and solar-powered Wi-Fi docking stations.But the company, which was started by the city of Montreal, was starved for capital and crippled by a disastrous decision to change software systems. Bankruptcy only added to its woes, as the company faced shortages of parts and products and as rivals snatched up top customers, like the new Seattle bike-share system.The industry, in the meantime, has evolved. Once a curiosity favored by politicians to improve their environmental credentials, bike sharing has increasingly become an accepted piece of transit infrastructure. Major cities with established systems are expanding them, while communities outside Europe and North America are turning to bike sharing as a partial answer to urban gridlock.In the early days, PBSC was one of the few companies to focus on bike sharing, making it the default choice for many cities. Now PBSC, which supplies systems to 15 cities and two university campuses, must compete against a growing number of suppliers of sophisticated equipment and technology. Some of those newcomers have surpassed PBSC with advances like smartphone apps to access bikes.In one of his first moves, Mr. Rodi hired nearly two dozen developers to fix PBSCs software problems and then to bring the system into the age of the mobile Internet. He is also crisscrossing the globe to find new customers and to keep existing ones. Mr. Rodi says he is willing to spend tens of millions if necessary to revive the companys fortunes.Will we have success with it? he said. Yes, sir, we will have a success with it.When Montreal introduced its bike-sharing system in 2009, city officials simply wanted to make commuting easier. The city would be blanketed with almost 10,000 bike stations to fill in gaps not covered by trains, subways and buses.But the Montreal City Council didnt want to pay for the system, the Societe de Velo en Libre-Service, known more commonly as Bixi. So, like other cities, it funded the service in part through user fees and advertisements plastered on the bikes. To pay for the rest, officials were counting on creating an international business that would sell its proprietary bike-share technology to cities around the world.Montreals system wasnt the first large-scale municipal bike-sharing program, a distinction usually attributed to Copenhagen, which started one in 1995. But Bixi was considered one of the most innovative, with technologies specifically designed for bike sharing.One of the biggest attractions was the bike itself. Rather than using inexpensive equipment that proved vulnerable to vandalism and breakdowns, the industrial designer Michel Dallaire came up with a durable, if costly, aluminum bike. Modifications thwarted thieves from easily unbolting parts.That bike, nobody can argue with his bike, said Josh Squire, the chief executive of , a bike-share operator that does not use the Bixi technology.The Montreal company also developed free-standing docking stations with solar panels for power and Wi-Fi to transfer payment and operations data. The stations, which can be lifted onto the back of a truck, could be easily removed for road repairs, construction projects or unfriendly Montreal winters.But the citys dream of self-financing proved elusive. While money was flowing in from foreign buyers, it was immediately going out again to keep Montreals bikes rolling. Users could buy passes of various durations at rates that had been set unrealistically low, while operating costs were higher than anticipated. That left the company struggling to pay its suppliers.All this money, all this profit used to go in the Montreal operation, Mr. Rodi said. They were transferring that money to satisfy the politicians because that was the mandate of the company: Give us bike share.' While the cash problem was temporarily resolved with loans from the city, managements attention was soon distracted by a pricing spat with 8D Technologies, the supplier that created the software for Bixi. The city-owned company cut off its contract with 8D and developed new software on its own for future systems, including Citi Bike in New York.That hurried software was a disaster, not just because it was full of problems, but also in terms of customer relations. Jon Orcutt, who championed Citi Bike during his time as director of policy at the New York City Transportation Department, said it picked PBSCs technology based on the earlier software.That was not the system we got, he said. Mr. Orcutt, who left the department last year, blames the software, in part, for the introduction delays and other problems with Citi Bike. At one point, he said, docking stations failed 10 percent of the time to release a bike.The crisis for PBSC peaked in 2013. Amid disputes with suppliers over payments, shortages of bikes and parts developed. The Montreal authority repeatedly missed deadlines to file financial statements. Not long after he became Montreals mayor, Denis Coderre took action, placing Bixi in bankruptcy last year. A court allowed the city to keep its bike-share system while selling the international sales unit. What was supposed to have been a free ride cost Montreal about $25 million.Mr. Rodi, 59, is an unlikely champion for a bike-sharing technology company.Other than once riding a  route as a personal challenge, he rarely cycles. He has no background in transit or municipal infrastructure. His technology experience is minimal.While walking around a workshop at PBSCs new headquarters in a Montreal suburb, Mr. Rodi picked up a circuit board out of a tray of electronic components. Its function, he acknowledged, was a complete mystery to him.Mr. Rodi is nonetheless determined, likening his task to climbing Mount Everest, which he did in 2003. If you look from the outside it might be a big mess, he said. But I would say bigger the mountain, the higher the challenge; bigger the mess, the higher the challenge.After buying PBSC, Mr. Rodi made a major strategic shift, by getting the company out of the politically fraught business of actually operating bike-share systems. Instead, it would focus solely on selling hardware and software for others to run.Were going back to our core business, which was to build this machine, Mr. Rodi said. I dont need to worry about how many workers there are on this street or in that city. Its not my job.The recovery plan is two-pronged. For growth, PBSC is promoting bike sharing as the answer for cities with traffic congestion. The message, Mr. Rodi said, particularly resonates in Latin America. (The circuit boards that baffled him were destined for docking stations being built for a new system in Guadalajara, Mexico.)Perhaps more crucially, PBSC must convince its current customers that the chaos is over. Mr. Rodi is leading the quest for forgiveness, putting in 16-hour days and making visits around the world to system owners. Cupping his hands upward like a beggar holding a bowl, Mr. Rodi said, When you go like this to people and say Were human, people say: O.K., tell me what you have to tell me.' Mirte Mallory, the co-founder and director of , a bike-sharing program in Aspen, Colo., said PBSC tested her patience leading up to the bankruptcy. Not long after Mr. Rodi took over, she said, the situation changed. Instead of excuses and delay, Ms. Mallory said, the company was offering quick responses to requests.With just 100 bikes, 14 docking stations and a service shutdown each winter, the Aspen program relies heavily on visitors rather than regulars. Working with Aspens website developer, PBSC developed a system that allows visitors to register online in advance. They recognized that product development is what needs to happen, Ms. Mallory said.Complicating Mr. Rodis crusade is the hangover from PBSCs past.In the United States and some other markets, its systems were sold exclusively by . Since the Montreal companys bankruptcy, Alta has gone from marketing partner to competitor. Alta recently allied itself with PBSCs former software supplier, 8D, to win a contract to build a new system for Seattle.Alta also got its financial house in order. Previously an underfunded branch of a relatively small infrastructure planning firm, Alta was bought in October by a group of private investors that includes the chief executives of the Related Companies, the large New York real estate firm, and Equinox, the fitness chain. As Altas new head, they installed Jay Walder, the former chairman and chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York, who also held a senior position at Transport for London, the citys transportation authority.Both of those cities transit systems currently use PBSC technology. Alta also oversees other programs, relying on the PBSC technology, in Toronto; Boston; Washington, D.C.; Columbus, Ohio; Chattanooga, Tenn.; and in some of the Bay Area. The situation makes PBSCs status in those places more uncertain.Other competitors, too, are muscling into PBSCs turf.Mr. Squire of CycleHop, which operates bike-sharing systems in seven cities, said that he admired PBSCs bikes and might do business with Mr. Rodi. But he recently rejected its technology after winning the contract to run Ottawas system. He said the PBSC docks and bikes previously used there, which have since been sold, couldnt make up for the buggy software.This year, CycleHop will work with , a Manhattan company that produces bikes, docks and system software. Mr. Squire said he was impressed by how Socials system allows users to rent and unlock its bicycles by using a smartphone app. Hes ahead, but hes behind, Mr. Squire said of Mr. Rodi and PBSC.

After resigning his seat in disgrace last month, the former Democrat ran in the special election as an independent, handily beating his Republican and Democratic challengers. He won nearly 43 percent of the vote Tuesday, in a largely-minority district that twists through various counties near Richmond.He was sworn in late Wednesday morning, shortly before the State Legislature began its 2015 session.In perhaps the most bipartisan move that might occur in the Virginia Legislature this year, lawmakers from both parties scrambled Wednesday to prevent Mr. Morrissey from serving  or to at least severely censure him.Mr. Morrisseys election tonight does not change the fact that his actions fall grievously short of the standards of a public servant in the House of Delegates, said William J. Howell, the Republican speaker of the House, in a prepared statement Tuesday night.Democrats were no more captivated by the prospect of their former party mates return. We will be exploring every avenue in regard to his status as a member of the House of Delegates, said the Democratic House minority leader, David J. Toscano, and the partys caucus chairman, Scott A.

With his curfew, though, he learned of his victory from the confines of Henrico County Jail East, where he presumably has access to a pay phone. He did not return emails or phone messages left at his law firm Wednesday.Mr. Morrissey served as  of  from 1989 to 1993. He was once stripped of his law license, which was later reinstated. He was elected in 2007 to the , where he served until resigning in December.Mr. Morrissey is the first convict to win elected office in Virginia, but he does have some historical company.

Representative Matthew Lyon of Vermont was re-elected to Congress in 1798 while serving time for sedition after maligning President John Adams.Other than removing Mr. Morrissey from office  a difficult task as he was duly elected by voters  his peers can give the lawmaker a host of other punishments.

Or maybe bronzed.Im getting a little teary here.Todays prices made filling up the tank  a big tank, because the rental agency upgraded me to an S.U.V. from the more economical car Id asked for  something close to a tawdry thrill.But great as that was for me, cheap oil isnt good for everybody. For example, its part of what sent the Russian ruble into a tailspin. That, in turn, is bad news for Vladimir V. Putin. (Which many people would see as good news  a problem he cant fix by jailing somebody or taking off his shirt. But I digress.) Many nations and states balance their budgets on oil revenue, and, closer to home, many stock portfolios invest heavily in the energy sector.Tracking the pros and the cons of falling energy prices can give you a bad case of whiplash. For example, damage to energy industries prospects is good news to those who want to see us move away from investment in fossil fuels and hope to curb . Yet low oil prices make renewable energy sources like solar and wind less attractive financially, making it harder to curb climate change.On the other hand, the lower prices could also allow the government to finally raise the gas tax. After all, this tax finances highway construction, and it hasnt been raised for two decades. But  ha-ha!  who am I kidding? We dont raise taxes in this country.Oh, its good to laugh.Anyway, the situation may lead consumers to spend more, adding power to the economy. After all, cheaper gas prices . But if that happens, we could get inflation.Its good! Its bad! Who knows?The strangest effect of low energy prices is that for every dollar off the cost of a barrel of oil, American consumers seem to lose an I.Q. point. We turn away from economical, fuel-saving cars and go back to our beloved gas guzzlers, as if we believe low prices will last forever. That is the triumph of hope over experience.Still, it can be liberating, throwing caution and common sense to the wind. It may be time for me to finally abandon gas sippers like the Smart and the Honda Civic and to buy the cars Ive hankered for as part of my American birthright. So Ive been looking into used Hummers. They make a real statement: A 2003 version of the humongous H2 was once said to get just 10  in the city.G.M. announced in 2010 that it was   another sign that car companies are underestimating the guzzle lust of the American consumer. Even discontinued, ! The Washington Post reported that sales of used Hummers and other beasts have jumped as gas prices have fallen.I could buy something even bigger  say, the kind of tour bus that rock stars use, with lavish quarters in the back for sleeping and partying. I missed my chance last year to buy one of Willie Nelsons old Honeysuckle Rose buses, which sold for $80,000  a steal, considering that you might get a contact high from the leftover pot smoke wafting out of the old upholstery.But why settle for secondhand when I could buy something new? The Bugatti Veyron gets about . At , however, its out of even my imaginations price range. Instead, I could spring for a four-wheel drive Cadillac Escalade, some models of which get  in the city; starting at less than , they are so much more reasonable.I could pay for one of those instead of, say, sending my youngest to college. After all, dont I deserve the best? And if were not going to fix our highways or the environment, what kind of future is he going to have, anyway?Heres the problem, though. Once I start, I cant stop. Why settle for a ho-hum Hummer when, if I really want to impress the neighbors, I can buy an actual military armored transport vehicle?I spent time in Ferguson, Mo., last year, and let me tell you that nothing quite makes an impression like an MRAP  a mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicle  grinding its way down a city street. Yes, these monsters cost the military hundreds of thousands of dollars. But  have gotten them for  each  less than I paid for my Smart car  or even free. Id probably have to claim to be a police department to get a good deal, but with all the money saved on gas, I can hire lawyers who can convince the government of anything.And these vehicles are a prudent choice: Theres probably plenty of room in back for those big packages of toilet paper from Costco.CLEARLY, there is money to be made from this thinking. I am not the only stupid person out there. I am not even a leading indicator of stupidity. If I want to consume conspicuously, plenty of others must be ready to consume not just conspicuously, but also flagrantly, even idiotically. Smart guys can profit from the excess of others.Sure, you could be boring and look into energy mutual funds, on the assumption that things will turn up again sometime. But isnt it better to bet on guzzling and consumption  to create a portfolio based on big honking vehicles and wretched excess?Wall Street, this is your metier. Nobody knows excess like yall do. Will you step up? Everybody talks about trying to get in on the smart money. But there have got to be even bigger profits on betting dumb.This wont last. Weve all been here before, and know that what goes down will go up again.

{"body": "WHENEVER markets are hot,  companies tend to go far off the beaten track in their hunt for better returns.Perhaps too far.The ultralow interest rates of the last several years have stoked a demand for mutual funds with higher returns. Most of that mom-and-pop money has gone into mainstream mutual funds that make simple bets on the major stock and bond markets. But a large chunk of it has been plowed into funds that have taken much more adventurous approaches. Hugely popular in recent years are funds that invest in opaque debt markets or deploy hedge-fund-like strategies.But now, regulators and even some fund company executives are asking what might happen to such funds if their shareholders want to redeem them en masse during severe market turbulence.Many of these funds have investments that are illiquid, the Wall Street word for assets that rarely trade or would be hard to sell quickly. In a market rout, when many shareholders are trying to get out, illiquidity of assets could become a big problem. Specifically, the funds might not be able to sell the investments fast enough to raise the cash needed to make timely payments to the departing shareholders.A fund that does not manage liquidity risk in its portfolio could have difficulty meeting redemptions if it came under stress, , chairwoman of the ,  in December.The commission has a longstanding rule that says fund investors must be able to get their money out of a mutual fund within seven days.Mutual fund specialists who cater to retail investors have been highlighting the potential dangers of funds that have illiquid assets.As investors go through the process of picking mutual funds, its something that everyone in that process needs to be thinking about, Sumit Desai, an analyst at Morningstar, said.Ms. White said the commission was scrutinizing funds to assess several potential areas of risk. She noted that one focus was the liquidity of mutual fund holdings. The review may lead the commission to propose new rules for mutual funds, including new regulations on illiquid assets.The commission is not setting out to shield retail investors from losses when markets fall. Instead, its aim is to make sure that mutual funds have not strayed beyond their core mission, which is to provide transparent investments that dont spring nasty surprises.And the danger of that happening increases as fund portfolios veer from the main stock and bond markets, some asset management analysts say.In mature bull markets, you do see people in the mutual funds space going into illiquid assets, said Stephen Tu, an analyst at Moodys Investors Service who covers asset management companies. Anytime the funds venture into investments that are not publicly traded, it entails new risks.The fund companies say they have taken precautions that will ensure that the mutual funds have the cash to make payouts to shareholders  and they note that mutual funds held up well during the 2008 financial crisis.But the growth of funds that might have illiquid assets has caught the eye of several regulatory agencies.The S.E.C., for instance, is currently reviewing alternative funds, which, like some hedge funds, may engage in complicated strategies that can be difficult to unwind. Ten years ago, alternative funds had $33 billion in assets under management; now they have $456 billion, according to data from Lipper. During the financial crisis, many hedge funds had to restrict withdrawals by their investors. And another severe market shock could test these alternative mutual funds, Mr. Tu said.Some concerns right now revolve around mutual funds that invest in leveraged loans.These are bank loans made to companies with low credit ratings. The loans are mostly illiquid and they have yields below those on junk bonds. Even so, mutual funds have found certain features of the loans attractive. The assets of the borrowing company secure the loans. And the interest rate on the loans moves higher if benchmark interest rates go up.An archaic feature of the leveraged loan market could present particular problems for mutual funds. When funds sell stocks and most types of bonds, they can count on getting the cash from the sale in three days.But with leveraged loans, it can often take two weeks or more, far longer than the seven days mutual funds have to make redemption payments to shareholders. So if many shareholders tried to leave a leveraged loan fund at once, the fund might struggle to raise enough cash in time.Companies that manage leveraged loan mutual funds say they have made preparations to deal with potential illiquidity problems.One large fund, Oppenheimers  fund, has a $2.5 billion credit line that it could draw on if it needed cash to meet redemptions. In a recent interview, Joseph Welsh, a manager of the fund, said Wall Street banks have shown so far that they can help mutual funds quickly sell leveraged loans.Mutual funds can also focus on loans that are more liquid and could be sold more easily to raise cash. These might include loans to large and prominent companies. Mr. Welshs fund, for instance, holds leveraged loans made to Hilton and American Airlines. People ought to know were lending to some of the biggest companies in the country, he said.The fund had $19 billion of assets under management at the end of 2013 and experienced outflows of $1.56 billion last year, according to data from Morningstar. It returned 0.55 percent in 2014, in line with the 0.58 percent average gain for bank loan mutual funds.FUND companies say they have been able to meet redemptions during past periods of turbulence because they have taken very seriously the requirement to be able to pay out within seven days, said Robert C. Grohowski, senior counsel at the Investment Company Institute, which represents asset management firms. That is one of the bedrock, sacrosanct legal-regulatory requirements for anyone who runs a mutual fund, he said, That is one section that you dont play fast and loose with.Fund managers also point out that the recent outflows from leveraged loan funds have not stopped departing shareholders from getting their cash in a timely manner.Appetite for leveraged loans has fallen in recent months as investors have pulled money out of a range of riskier markets around the world. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that invest in bank loans  mostly leveraged loans  experienced $13.8 billion of outflows from the end of 2013 through November 2014, according to Morningstar. The outflow is equivalent to nearly 10 percent of the $144 billion in assets held by the loan funds at the end of 2013.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "PETER EAVIS", "title": "Gauging Funds Emergency Preparedness  - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/business/gauging-funds-emergency-preparedness.html", "date": "JAN. 9, 2015"},

Cellphones disappeared, and hands clutched hot cups of coffee instead.

{"body": "Opacity is Katherine Waterstons stock in trade. On screen, her disarmingly childlike features are as hard to read as the fine print on a lease, a quality that has set her apart in a string of film roles, most recently that of Shasta Fay Hepworth, the oddly inscrutable temptress of Paul Thomas Andersons Inherent Vice.Given her star turn as a carefree hippie turned avatar of hard-edge chic, it was startling to find that the actress, who gusted into the  boutique on the Lower East Side a full 50 minutes late, appeared to be as candid, approachable and endearingly girlie as a high school cheerleader.All contrition, but pretty sure shed be forgiven, she made up for lost time at the racks, slipping on a discreet-looking camel-tone boy coat of Ms. Zadehs design, then tucking her shoulder-length hair into a Garboesque fedora that lent her the spirited yet faintly shady air of the character she plays.Her choices, she acknowledged, were not unlike the clothes that she actually wears out and about in the East Village, where she makes her home  the kind of camouflage endorsed by that breed of self-consciously stylish Manhattanites who embrace anonymity as a badge of cool.Ive always enjoyed disappearing into a crowd in New York, said Ms. Waterston, 34. As an actor I love to spy, and its hard to be a good spy if everyone is looking at you. Also Im pretty shy. I dont really like a lot of attention.Attention chases her just the same, impelling her, as awards season approaches, to shed her reflexively self-effacing look (which on the day of the interview consisted of a deep navy Isabel Marant coat, white T-shirt and reedy black jeans) for the kind of dazzling camera bait that befits her current drawing power.Tall and willowy, with an innocently upturned mouth, she is, so say style-world insiders, the latest in red carpet catnip. Katherine is definitely one to watch, said Bryan Smith of the Wall Group, which represents a roster of high-powered Hollywood stylists. Shes been recently sighted, Mr. Smith said, in consummately camera-ready labels including Prada, Elie Saab and Altuzarra.Inherent Vice, which is now in limited release, will open nationally on Jan. 9. In December, Ms. Waterston appeared at the films Hollywood premiere in a shoulder-baring satin Christian Dior dress accessorized with nothing more impressive than a ponytail and scarlet lips. Her stylist, Ryan Hastings, who did not respond to an interview request, directed her to the house, which lent her the dress  a good thing, she said, since while she had always longed to wear Dior, at the time I didnt have two pennies to rub together.So sophisticated was the dress that Catherine Kallon, whose popular blog, RCFA (), assesses each stars impact on awards night, pronounced Ms. Waterston captivating. Her style, which tends toward dramatic understatement, is much like Rooney Maras, Ms. Kallon posted last month. Yet Katherine appears to have much more confidence on the red carpet.Ms. Waterstons turnout for the films New York premiere in October was brazen by comparison: a sveltely tailored evening jacket sheared away to the waist to offer a teasing glimpse of breast  a look that in its starkly modern way was every bit as provocative as the slashed-to-the-navel Versace gown Jennifer Lopez so memorably wore to the 2000 .Still, Ms. Waterstons revealing black outfit is apt to strike audiences for Inherent Vice as positively demure. In Mr. Andersons puzzling and often disorienting noir, set in dissolute 1970s Los Angeles, the actress taunts her ex, played by a wild-haired, mutton-chopped Joaquin Phoenix, with an affectless soliloquy delivered entirely in the nude.Questioned exhaustively about the sequence, which is among the films most riveting, she offered a studied response: All acting is nudity, she repeatedly told reporters. Its all vulnerable, and a little bit scary.Her father, the actor Sam Waterston, took in the scene unflappably, his reaction as measured as those of Jack McCoy, his famously laconic alter ego in Law and Order. It really was no big whoop, he  the other day, adding pointedly that he found the moment brave.Certainly the sequence reinforced a consensus among Hollywood savants that Ms. Waterstons was a breakout performance destined to advance her career. (She had just been cast opposite Michael Fassbender in the forthcoming biographical film Jobs, as Chrisann Brennan, the much put-upon girlfriend of Steve Jobs, and the mother of his first child.)Im thinking a lot about this label breakout performance,  Ms. Waterston said, turning briefly aside, as she did routinely when she needed to process a notion. On an emotional level, it resonates, she decided after a pause. I often feel like a caged animal: Theres a side of me that wants to emerge.Actually, her performances have been as multidimensional and refractive as a prism, its facets displayed in succession of stage and screen roles that include Bachelorette (2010), The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby (2013) and The Babysitters, a 2007 indie release that in retrospect was a kind of audition for Shasta.Paul may have been one of two people who saw it, Ms. Waterston joked of the film, a dark tale of a naive lovestruck teenager who hardens by degrees in the wake of a disappointing tryst with a neighbor, ultimately masterminding a high school prostitution ring.Ms. Waterstons flinty portrayal apparently wormed its way into Mr. Andersons consciousness, prompting him to cast her years later in Vice. As to why it so affected the director, I would never dream of asking, she said.In the film, as in the  novel that inspired it, Shasta sets events in motion when she materializes zipped into a formfitting minidress.Shes gone down the popular culture conveyor belt, Ms. Waterston said of her character, who seems ill at ease in her store-bought frock. That dress was constricting, she recalled, but in the film that discomfort served me.The film also offers glimpses of a more loose-limbed Shasta, mostly in flashbacks that show her gamboling on the beach in a concert T-shirt and flower-pattern bikini bottom, and in another sequence, in that other great hippie emblem, a gaily embroidered peasant blouse.In fact, I have an old one of my mothers, Ms. Waterston said, though wearing it now, I would feel absurd.There were times growing up that she envied her mother, Lynn Louisa Woodruff, an actress in a family of actors.eShed actually been to the Fillmore East, Ms. Waterston said with unalloyed awe. She herself succumbs on occasion to nostalgia for the era of her parents youth, a longing that starts with the clothes. What appeals about the 70s is the celebration of the female form, the lack of constriction, Ms. Waterston said, the way a pair of pair of jeans fits on the hips at their widest point  so natural.And, to her mind, liberating. I was devastated when they stopped making sailors pants with bell bottoms, she said. Theres something sort of spirited about the way they affected a mans gait. They project something good-natured.As did the music of the day. Janis Joplin had an honest voice, Ms. Waterston said, a voice in tune with the 70s, a period she imagines as an honest time.It was a time she likes to think of as easygoing, unscripted and unsettling. Sometimes I think everyone around me has been pulled aside and given some sort of cheat sheet, that I didnt get, she said stoically. With that she started into a tale of walking into a bar to meet a friend. On greeting her, Ms. Waterston was met with a cool gaze of perplexity, as if this woman had never seen me in her life.As it turned out, the unresponsive visitor, who had entered the bar by sheer coincidence, was her good friends twin. Just one of many examples, Ms. Waterston mused, of life imitating Inherent Vice.

{"body": "The dress was a pale confection, designed by Dolce & Gabbana as if by way of Sylvia Weinstock. Garlanded with cloth flowers, it had a train so long it called not just for an attendant but possibly its own ZIP code. It was worn to this years Met Gala by Tabitha Simmons, a comely British shoe designer enlisted that spring evening to provide an engineering solution: a gown-propulsion device.So outlandishly large was the train that guests were forced to cluster around its edges like refugees at a border crossing. One, the designer  even managed to become marooned by the dress, separated from his group by an acre of impassable tulle.Getting around the dress was clearly impossible, vaulting it out of the question. And so Mr. Garavani did the only logical thing when faced with that particular party dilemma. He walked across.Perhaps its a stretch to suggest there was something emblematic in that practical gesture, an image for a year in which a surge in the American economy suddenly brought out all the big dresses, all the big money, all the big multinationals equipped with the budgets to fund a ceaseless round of parties and spectacles on a scale of expenditure destined to give Thomas Piketty pause.As if in a never-ending loop, the year now nearly past saw Christian Dior e to stage a fashion show for 1,000 guests, Rihanna and Marion Cotillard among them, who came by trains, planes, town cars and water taxis (and halfway around the world, in the case of editors flown in from India and China and put up at five-star hotels at Diors expense). It saw Louis Vuitton colonize the Museum of Modern Art for a lavish wingding celebrating the introduction of a line of handbags in which the labels famous logo was reimagined by, among others, Cindy Sherman, Frank Gehry and Karl Lagerfeld. It saw  taken over by an Instagram flash mob for the opening of a Topshop store, with a Twitter mirror installed for taking celebrity selfies, a Beyonce flyover and a performance by Lionel Richie, as if the scene were not already adequately unreal.The spate of entertainments brought with them a Valentino-type problem: How to traverse it all? Unless they were Padma Lakshmi  who seems to possess the godlike ability to be in all places at all times  red-carpet types and the news media-anointed were challenged this past year to navigate evenings like ... well, lets at random choose Nov. 17.At 5:15 p.m. that day Bergdorf Goodman unveiled for invited guests its wizardly holiday windows; at 6:30 a gala party was held for the ASCAP centennial; simultaneously, at 7 p.m., there was Everybody, Rise! A Celebration of Elaine Stritch; a party for the seventh annual Mimi awards; and the 14th anniversary gala for the nonprofit RxArt, sponsored by Chanel. And lets not omit The Imitation Game premiere at the Ziegfeld Theater, with a party afterward at Tavern on the Green.That was just Monday. Any person of moderate social enterprise had the choice of at least five separate balls or galas every night for the rest of that week.It was a total pile-on, David Monn, a pre-eminent event planner, said of the recent season. I have never had a year that has had so many things going on in one night, he added. Ten things in a night is ridiculous.For Martha Vietor Glass, president of the Society of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the evening hours from September onward were an unending sprint. The Society had four events and six sponsor parties, Ms. Glass said. In my civilian life Ive been really busy, too. People are finally feeling a bit better about the economy, I think, so the parties all seemed to be bigger and better, the food better and grander; sort of but not exactly like the 80s.The shiny, if in many ways benighted, Reagan years were on the minds of some this season, as dinner parties proliferated and with them the battle to land the most desirable guests, which often means those with the best Instagram metrics.We did a count of events, and actually this November we were three parties below November 2013, said Billy Farrell, whose event photography agency, BFA, has kept him out every night for more than a decade. But the spending is up nearly a third from last year, and clients were throwing much larger parties, hiring more vendors and photographers, Mr. Farrell said. Im not an economist, but toward the end of the year, you could really track the expenditure as the luxury brands raised their spending on entertaining, because it showed their fiscal health, it showed they had it in the budget to do.Few New Yorkers have spun more energetically on the social Habitrail than the writer Bob Colacello, who memorably chronicled his evening adventures in an Interview magazine column called Out. Never in his decades on the scene, Mr. Colacello recently said, have things been quite as frenetic as they are now.The scene has become crazier than ever, and a lot of it has to do with the booming art market and the fact that rich people now follow the auctions much more than they follow horse racing or the couture, Mr. Colacello said by phone from the back of a taxi as he raced to an art world lunch. One of the best parties I went to all season was a party for Valentinos book at Christies, where there was everyone from Lily Safra to the Netherlands princess on Valentinos right.As swank as that party may have been, it was just one among many  a gala dinner for the arts patron Leonard Lauder; another for the oil billionaire and conservative David Koch, who underwrote the new Metropolitan Museum of Arts public plaza and then named it for himself; yet another for the deep-pocketed acquisitions committee of the Museum of Modern Art.Its more over-the-top, Mr. Colacello said of the recent surge of entertainments, five or more a night and in almost all five boroughs. Its uptown, downtown, Brooklyn, he added, and even in the Bronx, if you count last weeks gala at the New York Botanical Garden. It reminds me a bit of the 80s, with big gowns, big jewelry, big money spent in restaurants, he said. Now, as then, the Champagne rivers are flowing, and they are vintage French and not some California sparkling. The caviar mounded again in iced silver buckets is also imported.

{"body": "Amanda Moskowitz had no interest in peering into a crystal ball. She was the type who knew where she was going, the girl who took first prize in statewide oratory contests, snagged the lead in school plays, and was admitted to Brown University. Fortunes were to be made, she believed, not told.And yet, Ms. Moskowitz, a native of Gastonia, N.C., remembered listening politely about 10 years ago as a hairstylist and part-time psychic predicted that Ms. Moskowitz would meet her special someone through work, at a big event, where people would be wearing nice clothes. That someone, the psychic said, would be Southern.Ms. Moskowitz forgot about that prophecy until a few months ago, as she prepared for her wedding to Bradford Hargreaves last month.She met Mr. Hargreaves in October 2008 when she, a fledgling entrepreneur, was in Stamford, Conn., pitching potential investors on her business, then a mobile messaging and voice company.She had toted promotional materials from the train station in heavy rain, with a rough wind buffeting her and the big sign she carried. After eight hours of explaining her company to a mostly middle-age, married crowd, she was packing her bags when a lanky young man  Mr. Hargreaves  approached and asked for one last pitch.Id seen this incredibly beautiful woman across the room but hadnt found a moment to speak with her, said Mr. Hargreaves, who was also promoting his start-up, , an online game that attracted 11,000 people, most of them college students. He was 22 and a recent graduate of Yale. I walked toward her without preparing anything interesting to say, so I asked, What does your company do? Ms. Moskowitz, her natural vivaciousness waning from a long and fruitless day cultivating investors, inhaled deeply and began a shopworn pitch about her company.But Mr. Hargreaves interrupted. Are you mad at me? he asked.It was so disarming and sincere, Ms. Moskowitz said, there was nothing I could do but laugh. He wasnt challenging me, he was just asking. I instantly liked him.They shared a seat on a Metro-North train back to Manhattan, where they both had apartments.As the psychic hairstylist had envisioned, Mr. Hargreaves was indeed a Southerner. He grew up in , a village of about 1,300 people, which has one stoplight and is 30 miles from the nearest grocery store.If his town sounds like something conjured by Frank Capra, then Mr. Hargreaves, with his twinkly enthusiasm and courtly manner, is a throwback to Jimmy Stewart.His father, Chester Hargreaves, is a forester with the Hancock Timber Resources Group, for whom he manages thousands of square miles of loblolly pines in the southern United States. He recalled Brad, as a young boy, walking in the woods with him.He always knew the way, even when he was this high, Chester Hargreaves said, gesturing about three feet off the ground. He paid attention to things. If you gave him a toy car, he tried to take it apart and see how it worked.Brads mother, Patricia, a homemaker, said her son would pore over maps and books. He was never rambunctious, like other kids, she said. He was curious about so many things, loved exploring.On the train, Mr. Hargreaves and Ms. Moskowitz discovered that in addition to being Southern, Ivy League graduates living in Manhattan, with budding careers in technology (between the two of them, she estimates they have worked in a dozen other start-ups), they both liked to travel, near and far. For their first date, a week after they met, they spent hours walking around Brooklyn Heights and Carroll Gardens, past stately townhouses decorated with pumpkins and on sidewalks plush with colorful leaves.Within a month, they were dating. Their nascent romance coincided with the decline of his company, one that he and his three partners had been unable to make profitable. In May 2009, about six months after he began dating Ms. Moskowitz, he found himself firing staff and shutting it down.It was the worst experience of my life, he said. And she stood by me, she was that support structure, that rock.His professional life reignited in 2010, after he and three partners founded General Assembly, a digital trade school that teaches skills like technology, design and entrepreneurship. The company, which officially opened in January 2011, employs 400 people and has 14 campuses worldwide, including in Sydney and Hong Kong. Mr. Hargreaves has been heralded in publications  and . Ms. Moskowitz is the founder of , a line of hair and body products for pregnant women.Their relationship, she said, kept getting better and better, and she began to realize that she wanted to marry him. Love is a constant interrogation, she said, citing a line from Milan Kunderas novel The Book of Laughter and Forgetting. That resonates with me because with Brad, theres always more to know.Both spoke of the melding of work and home, where business trips become road trips. A conference in Milan led to driving through the French and Italian Alps. Discussions about retailers, how to strategize their respective businesses, operating systems, and team dynamics are not left at the office.Amanda is such a source of stability and calm for him,  said Matthew O. Brimer, a fellow Yale classmate and business partner of Mr. Hargreaves. The warmth and love she provides allows him to put energy into the unknown.Mr. Hargreaves said: Were very big on rituals, on things that you do on a regular basis that give structure and credence to life. No matter what happens, you can go back to these. We each have our own business. Its a roller coaster, the ups, the downs.One of these rituals is their quarterly planning session, when they discuss money, business trips, vacations and social obligations. A Pinterest board they made for their wedding became an exercise in defining our aesthetic, Mr. Hargreaves said. Many weekend mornings, he makes eggs at their Manhattan apartment and they watch one or two episodes of a TV series.

She said yes, and put on a ring they had designed together.On Dec. 13, they married under a wedding canopy before 152 guests at Studio 450, a party space on West 31st Street between Pennsylvania Station and the High Line, with views of the Hudson River. Through the big casement windows, light flickered from the candles on the sills like the diamonds of the city skyline.Earlier, on the way to the ceremony in paralyzing traffic, many guests abandoned taxis and cars to walk.

Ms. Moskowitzs sister, Abigail Moskowitz, carried, as best she could, the satin train of her sisters wedding dress, as they threaded their way through the neighborhood in biting cold.Well, we wanted a New York wedding, Ms. Moskowitz said to Mr. Hargreaves, the hem of her dress lightly lined with soot and her black hair and brown eyes shining. As they stood in a fluorescent-lit elevator jammed with damp and cold guests headed to the ceremony, he leaned toward her and whispered, You look beautiful.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "STACEY STOWE", "title": "2 Entrepreneurs Know the Value in Serendipity - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/weddings/2-entrepreneurs-know-the-value-in-serendipity.html", "date": "JAN. 9, 2015"},
{"body": "It had been another long day for Eliza, a 41-year-old stay-at-home mother who lives in Los Angeles with her two sons. She had taken the boys, 10 and 13 at the time, to school, taken care of the house, and after putting them to bed, planned to relax in front of her computer.At least thats what she was hoping to do. Eliza opened her computer and started to search for a document, but based on previous searches, the term child porn appeared on the screen.I went into a panic, said Eliza, who was given anonymity to protect the identity of her children. Her mind started to race in a million different directions.Two nights later, as they were going to bed, she asked the older son if he had searched for child porn and if so, why. He said he was looking for porn made for children, she told me. He explained, embarrassed, that he just wanted to know what his body was supposed to look like at his age.Welcome to the new teenage years. Not long ago, boys and girls nearing that curious age might sneak a peek at Playboy or scour the underwear section of a J. C. Penney circular.Today, teenagers have easy access to a seemingly endless supply of pornography, including things that even many adults dont want to see, such as mock sexual violence, misogynistic videos and, in extreme cases, child pornography.At first, I told my son the next time he wanted to look at things like this, to talk to me and wed do it together, Eliza said. Yet as soon as the words left my mouth I realized, and said, No, no, no, that would be a terrible idea. Parents Ive spoken with who have young boys acknowledged that trying to stop them from seeing online pornography is all but impossible. One father, for example, said that he installed web filtering software on the home computer, only to learn that his son had watched a gross-out pornography clip at a friends house.I spoke with researchers at the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, who walked me through a number of long-term  that the group has been conducting since 2000 on childrens exposure to pornography. In one paper, the group found that 42 percent of online users ages 10 to 17 had seen pornography, and that 66 percent of those had seen it unwittingly, often as display ads on file-sharing sitesAnother  found that 93 percent of boys and 62 percent of girls were exposed to online pornography during their adolescence. You dont need to be a scientific researcher to realize thats a lot of exposure for children.For parents, this leaves two questions. First, is the pervasiveness of online pornography bad for todays youth, potentially creating a society of sexual deviants? And second, what can parents do to help protect their children?There is no definitive answer to the first question, although it is a running debate in the nations culture wars. For example, the 2013 movie , which starred Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a man hooked on pornography, prompted a new round of anti-pornography commentary, including one from a  arguing that online pornography is severely corrupting todays youth. I see a sexual and relational train wreck happening, the therapist said.But other experts who monitor teenagers and sexuality say that there is plenty of evidence pointing in the opposite direction.  has dropped sharply in recent years; the number of  that teenagers have is down; and the number of ninth graders having sexual intercourse has fallen, to cite just three examples.If you just look at the indicators of sexual responsibility, you dont see a generation of kids looking like they are off the rails, said David Finkelhor, an author of  on child abuse and a director of the  at the University of New Hampshire. But Dr. Finkelhor acknowledged that the long-term psychological effects of teenagers access to online pornography was still being determined.Which leads to the second question. Dr. Finkelhor and other experts I spoke with said that todays easy access to pornography, especially its violent and illegal forms, makes it imperative for parents to educate their children, not only about sex but specifically about online pornography, in all its flavors. And given how easy it is to find it online, it is important to inculcate them at an early age.Heres the new reality: Thanks to the Internet, children will see things that children probably shouldnt. Teenagers with active hormones will get together with their friends and, when parents are out of sight, seek out and explore dark and salacious imagery.So as uncomfortable and embarrassing as it may be for both parents and teenagers, part of raising a child today means explaining that, like Hollywood movies, pornography is often a fantasy that can take things to extremes.Also, children should be warned about the dark and dangerous material they may stumble across online. If parents dont, that uncomfortable and embarrassing feeling could be replaced with something much worse.Take it from Eliza. The last thing you want to find on the home computer is a previous search for the term child porn.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "NICK BILTON", "title": "Parenting in the Age of Online Pornography - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/style/parenting-in-the-age-of-online-porn.html", "date": "JAN. 7, 2015"},
{"body": "WASHINGTON   In the span of a month, the nations biggest banks and investment firms have twice won passage of measures to weaken regulations intended to help lessen the risk of another financial crisis, setting their sights on narrow, arcane provisions and greasing their efforts with a surge of lobbying and campaign contributions.The continuing assault on the 2010 Dodd-Frank law has achieved remarkable success, especially compared with the repeated failures of opponents of another 2010 law, the Affordable Care Act.The financial industry has been methodical, drafting technically complicated legislation that can pass the heavily Republican House with a few Democratic votes. And then, once approved, Wall Street has pushed to tack such measures on to larger bills considered too important for the White House to block.The House was back at it this week. Lawmakers approved by a vote of 250 to 175, with just eight Democrats in support, a broad measure to impose a variety of new restrictions on federal regulators, like stricter cost-benefit analyses and an expansion of judicial review. That measure would affect every regulatory agency, be it the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the century-old Food and Drug Administration. And like past attacks on the , it has little chance of overcoming a threat of a presidential veto.But House members also took up a narrower measure that would slow enforcement of Dodd-Frank requirements and weaken other regulations on financial services companies. The legislation will almost certainly pass on Wednesday with Democratic support, and although its future as a stand-alone bill is not bright, elements of it are expected to return on spending bills and other must-pass legislation in the future.This all works together: Put it up for stand-alone vote, get some Democrats on it, and then when you push it onto a must-pass bill, say its a bipartisan bill thats already passed, said Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, which favors tighter regulation of Wall Street. The strategy on Dodd-Frank is death by a thousand cuts.Even with other interest groups seeking the same consideration, the financial industry likes its chances.There are limited opportunities for action in both the House and Senate, said James Ballentine, a lobbyist at the American Bankers Association. And the moving trains generally have a lot of passengers on them.Proponents of regulation say that they are badly outgunned by an army of Wall Street lobbyists, and complain that the Obama administration has been too weak in its response.The president was slow in drawing the same kind of line on financial reform that he did on health care, said Barney Frank, the retired chairman of the House Financial Services Committee who helped write Dodd-Frank.The current efforts to undermine Dodd-Frank have been textbook lobbying. In the first three quarters of last year, the securities and investment industry spent nearly $74 million on lobbying  on 704 registered lobbyists  according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That was on track to easily beat out the $99 million spent in 2013.The Securities Industry and Financial Market Association, Wall Streets biggest lobbying group, had spent $5.8 million alone through September, the last data available. The group spent $5.2 million in all of 2013.Lobbying expenditures by every specific industry group declined in 2014, except for the finance, insurance and real estate sector. That sector increased its spending by 2.5 percent.As of Nov. 16, Wall Street banks and other financial interests had spent $1.2 billion on campaign contributions and lobbying combined, a total that was on track to beat spending in 2010, when Dodd-Frank was being considered in Congress, according to Americans for Financial Reform.And Wall Street has been a steady donor, particularly to members of the House Financial Services Committee, where the legislation typically gets started. During the last Congress, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the committee, received donations on 13 separate occasions from political action committees run by Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.Of even greater importance, no influential business group opposes Wall Streets effort, making more Democrats open to the campaign. By contrast, while the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, might have powerful interests  like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business  against it, the health insurance and hospital industries, along with leading pharmaceutical companies, are strongly opposing its repeal.In American politics, when a particularly economically motivated group gets behind something, that can be more powerful than an ideological viewpoint, Mr. Frank said, comparing his law to the Affordable Care Act. Nobody who makes their money in health care is going after that bill. There are a lot of people making money in finance that are going after this bill.Financial industry lobbyists say they are being unfairly pilloried. The changes they have won and further revisions they seek do not undermine the core of Dodd-Frank, they say. What has changed, they contend, is the rise of Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose vocal attacks on Wall Street and its denizens have polarized the issue.Sam Geduldig, who represents financial services companies, called her a game changer.Legislation now almost has a Warren litmus test, the liberal version of what is happening in the Republican Party with libertarians and  conservatives, he said. If Warren describes something as a gift to corporate industry, you have to kind of walk through that gantlet.Separately, MetLife, the insurance company, went to court on Tuesday challenging its designation as a systemically important financial institution, a label under Dodd-Frank that allows regulators to impose tighter rules aimed at lessening risk-taking that might threaten the overall financial system.Administration officials say the tide is turning in their favor. Last week, the House tried to pass a measure that would delay by two years Dodd-Franks requirement that banks sell off collateralized loan obligations, the bundled debt that helped cause the 2008 financial collapse. The bill was even titled the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act.But this time, most Democrats banded together against it, and the bill failed to get the two-thirds majority needed to pass under fast-track House rules. ( did vote for it.)Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, in  this weekend, said President Obama was prepared to defend the gains we have made against attempts to water down protections and expose the economy to the risky practices of the past.That measure is now back on the House floor under normal rules that require only a simple majority to pass, and the White House has issued a veto threat against the bill, which officials said puts working- and middle-class families at risk while benefiting Wall Street and other narrow special interests.But those stands came only after other Wall Street-backed measures were attached to Decembers spending bill that funds the government through September and last weeks bill reauthorizing federal terrorism insurance. Both were signed into law.You can argue that of all the very powerful special interests that work in this city, Wall Street is at the top of list, said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent and liberal populist from Vermont.For all its sway in Washington, Wall Street is also widely reviled. So, one of the secrets to its success is wrapping itself around a friendlier cause. Lobbyists have contended that measures long sought by the biggest banks and investment houses are actually for community banks, small businesses, farmers and ranchers.They have been very expert at controlling the narrative thus far, said Cornelius Hurley, director of the Boston University Center for Finance, Law and Policy.One of Congresss last acts of 2014 was to pass a measure largely repealing a Dodd-Frank provision that required banks to push the trading of exotic financial instruments known as derivatives into subsidiaries that are not eligible for deposit insurance and other forms of government support. Members of Congress, echoing Wall Streets lobbying pitch, said the so-called swaps push-out rule was too onerous for small community banks.In fact, according to the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, 95 percent of derivatives trading is conducted by five firms: Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. By keeping such activity under their federally regulated banking arms, those behemoths get to keep borrowing costs down.Mr. Ballentine, the banking industry lobbyist, said the chance of success had also increased as turnover in Congress reduced the number of lawmakers who voted on Dodd-Frank.There is a strong possibility, a strong possibility, that every single sentence in Dodd Frank is not perfect, he said.

Bush administration, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said Tuesday that he wanted to reverse the trend towards a national school board in federal education policy.Speaking on the floor of the Senate, Mr. Alexander said he wanted to put the responsibility back with states and local school districts to oversee public schools with as few mandates as possible from Washington.Mr. Alexander said that each state should decide its school standards without being required to seek federal approval.He released a draft bill proposal that offered two options: one that would retain the mandate of annual testing and one that would give states the freedom to choose between annual testing or testing once every three years. Mr. Alexander said the committee would try to come up with a bipartisan version to send to the full Senate.Congress has repeatedly tried to revise the Left Behind law since it came up for reauthorization in 2007, but has been stalled by partisan disagreement on fundamental issues like whether the federal government can direct states on how to hold schools accountable.On Monday, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan . Mr. Duncan reiterated the administrations commitment to testing students annually from third to eighth grade and then once in high school, as well as the use of test scores in teacher performance ratings.He was joined by civil rights groups and the group that represents state commissioners of education in calling for annual assessments of student progress and of whether the most vulnerable students among racial minorities and the poor were receiving an adequate education.Mr. Alexander, in a conference call with reporters, said he was open on the question of whether the federal government should mandate testing. Generally speaking, I want these discussions about testing, standards and accountability systems to move back to states and communities, where I think they belong, he said.Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said on Tuesday that she wanted to reduce redundant and unnecessary testing but remained committed to at least annual standardized tests.Without the tests, Ms. Murray said, some schools would not provide an adequate education and the victims will invariably be kids from poor neighborhoods, children of color and children with disabilities.

{"body": "TRENTON   As Gov.  delivered his State of the State address on Tuesday, it sounded less like the valedictory of a presidential hopeful on his way to bigger and better things than a defensive move by a politician anticipating the shots that could be leveled against him.Speaking in the ornate Assembly chamber full of local and state dignitaries, Mr. Christie seemed largely to be addressing, or pre-empting, criticisms  from Democrats, but also from fellow Republicans in a field of White House aspirants that becomes more crowded by the week.It has become fashionable in some quarters to run down our state, the governor said dismissively.He did not explicitly mention the problems that have already shaped his detractors critique: the eight credit downgrades on his watch, more than any other New Jersey governor; an unemployment rate that remains higher than the national average; the regain of only about half of the jobs lost in the recession even as the nation has recovered all those jobs and more.Instead, Mr. Christie urged his audience to consider where we were and how far weve come, noting that when he took office, unemployment was much higher, and that his Democratic predecessor had also struggled to balance the budget.The state of our state continues to get better, Mr. Christie said in an optimistic opening, but one that was well shy of the triumphal declaration of robust health that governors and presidents often deliver in these annual checkups.While Mr. Christie, 52, took the podium here as governor, he spoke as an all-but-declared presidential candidate. He pronounced the nation beset by anxiety and called for a New Jersey renewal and an American renewal.He returned to the themes he planned to highlight before pension problems and the  ate away at his approval ratings, presenting himself as a tell-it-like-it-is reformer who can rise above partisanship to do the right thing.Americas leadership in the world is called into question because of a pattern of indecision and inconsistency, Mr. Christie said. During this time of uncertainty, it seems our leaders in Washington would rather stoke division for their own political gain.Mr. Christie spent the biggest chunk of his speech on the need to streamline drug treatment and prisoner re-entry programs, an issue that resonates with liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans alike.He boasted of progress in Camden, where a new police force, a new schools superintendent and new businesses lured by state subsidies have produced optimism in what the governor repeatedly noted was once considered the most dangerous city in America.But his speech was more striking for its omissions. He did not mention the recovery from , which was once his calling card, but more than two years later has produced lingering resentment from homeowners struggling to rebuild. He declared that he would veto any income tax increase, but was silent on the idea of a gas tax increase, which even some Republicans believe is necessary to fill the states transportation trust fund and to fix bridges and roads.Nor did Mr. Christie mention Atlantic City, where one-third of the casinos closed in 2014, the fourth year in what had been a five-year plan by the governor to turn that struggling city around.Mr. Christie has been governor five years and has the scars to show for it. As he used his speech to pitch himself to a national audience, he had to explain some of those blemishes.So he argued that state employee pensions are underfunded because of poor decisions by governors and legislatures of both parties, over decades, not just years. He did not add that he failed to make the pension payments he himself had promised.And he emphatically declared  saying it twice  that his administration had contributed more money toward the states outstanding pension obligations than any other. (His critics note that his Democratic predecessor, Jon S. Corzine, contributed more, on a percentage basis.)Mr. Christie blamed high taxes for the recent news , but offered no hint at how to reduce taxes. And he made a swipe at some overly partisan corners of this chamber who have continued to press questions about the scandal that started with the disclosure of his administrations role in closing lanes to the George Washington Bridge, apparently in an act of political retribution.Mr. Christie has traveled the country as chairman of the  over the last year, and on those travels, he said, anxiety was the most palpable emotion I saw and felt. He described an 82-year-old woman in Vero Beach, Fla., who grabbed his hand in a rope line and asked: Whats happening to our country? We used to control events. Now events control us.The governor said: We need to address this anxiety head on. We need to renew the spirit and the hopes of our state, our country and our people.A poll released on Tuesday showed the difficulties Mr. Christie faces at home. Voters in a , by Fairleigh Dickinson University, declared their state  on taxes and spending, the economy, ethics and the lives of citizens. More people disapproved than approved of his job performance.The governor once planned to run for president based on his ability to attract broad support in blue-state New Jersey, but the poll showed him losing support he once enjoyed among independents, women and public employee union households.By a wide margin, New Jersey voters said he was more concerned with running for president than running the state.On this last criticism, Mr. Christie seems unfazed. He met with reporters from national media outlets before the speech, causing a minor uproar among reporters for New Jersey outlets, who were shut out. He will spend Wednesday in South Carolina, delegating his powers, as he has for most of the past month, to his lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "KATE ZERNIKE", "title": "Christies National Aspirations Underlie State Speech  - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/nyregion/chris-christie-state-of-the-state-speech-new-jersey.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "ALEXANDRIA, Va.   The Justice Department on Tuesday pressed ahead with the prosecution of a former  official, a day after it said it would not force a reporter for The New York Times to testify at the trial.The former official, Jeffrey Sterling, is accused of revealing a covert operation to disrupt Irans , the details of which were included in a 2006 book, State of War, by , the Times reporter. In attempting to compel Mr. Risens testimony for the past seven years, the Justice Department had argued that his account was crucial to their case. But under pressure from journalism groups and advocates, Attorney General  agreed not to force Mr. Risen to reveal his sources, leaving the government with a case that is largely circumstantial.In opening arguments in Federal District Court here on Tuesday, prosecutors said that much of the information that Mr. Risen published about the Iranian operation was known only to Mr. Sterling, whom they described as a disgruntled employee who was bitter that the C.I.A. refused to settle a discrimination lawsuit he had filed. They said Mr. Sterling caused lasting harm with his disclosures.He struck back with the only weapon he had: secrets, James L. Trump, one of the prosecutors, told the court.Edward B. MacMahon, a defense lawyer, described Mr. Sterling as a whistle-blower and said the charges were retribution for filing the discrimination lawsuit and raising questions about the management of the Iranian operation with Congress. He said that Mr. Risen has said that he had multiple sources, and suggested that other C.I.A. officials or Capitol Hill staffers could have provided the information, a possibility that he said investigators never ruled out before focusing exclusively on Mr. Sterling.Its suspicion, backed up by anger, and the fact that the C.I.A. despises Mr. Sterling, Mr. MacMahon said, describing what he said was the basis for the governments case.Mr. Sterling is the latest in a string of former officials and contractors the Obama administration has charged with discussing national security matters with reporters. A former C.I.A. officer, , is in federal prison, as are two former government contractors,  and .Chelsea Manning, the Army private formerly known as , is in military prison for providing secret documents to WikiLeaks. , a former National Security Agency official, pleaded guilty to minor offenses and avoided jail time. And most prominently, , a former N.S.A. contractor who downloaded thousands of that agencys documents, has fled to Russia to avoid criminal charges.The White House has defended the crackdown, saying the leaks have jeopardized national security. But journalists say the prosecutions have made it harder to cover national security beyond what is released in official statements and sanctioned leaks, pointing out that the most explosive stories of the war on terrorism  warrantless wiretapping, secret prisons, waterboarding, prisoner abuses and   have all relied on unauthorized disclosure of classified information to journalists. On Tuesday, a coalition of government accountability groups, liberal advocates and journalism organizations released a petition calling on Mr. Holder to stop the prosecution of Mr. Sterling.Twelve jurors and two alternates, an even mix of men and women, will hear the case in a trial that is expected to last three weeks. Prosecutors released a witness list that includes , the former national security adviser, as well as several C.I.A. operatives who will testify behind screens and reveal only their first names and last initials.Ms. Rice is expected to testify about White House efforts to keep The New York Times from publishing an article by Mr. Risen in 2003 in which he described the C.I.A.s Iranian operation. In a meeting with Mr. Risen and Jill Abramson, the newspapers Washington bureau chief at the time, officials argued that the story would jeopardize national security. The Times agreed not to publish the information, a decision Ms. Abramson has said she now regrets. Mr. Risen included it in his book years later.In the C.I.A. program described in the book, the agency used a former Soviet nuclear scientist, code-named Merlin, to try to pass blueprints for a nuclear component to Iran. The blueprints were intentionally flawed, which the C.I.A. hoped would lead Iran to invest time and money in a project that was doomed to fail. Mr. Risens book suggests that the flaws were easily discoverable, a fact the government disputes. Mr. Trump said that Mr. Sterling was the only person who raised the concerns that Mr. Risen included in his book.Prosecutors said they had emails and phone records proving that Mr. Sterling and Mr. Risen were communicating. But defense lawyers said they only proved that Mr. Risen was trying to get information about the program from everyone involved.Defense lawyers have also raised a legal technicality that could sink the case: Prosecutors must prove that a crime was committed in Virginia, where the case was filed. Mr. Sterling was living in New York at the time, while Mr. Risen worked in Washington and lived in Maryland.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "MATT APUZZO", "title": "Trial Begins for Former C.I.A.

{"body": "Walter Berns, a distinguished constitutional scholar and government professor whose disgust with Cornell Universitys response to the armed takeover of a campus building by black students propelled him to become a leading voice of the neoconservative movement, died on Saturday at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 95.His daughter, Elizabeth Fradkin, confirmed his death.It was not for nothing that Cornell was widely known as the Big Red during the 1960s, when passions over civil rights and the war in Vietnam provoked convulsive student radicalism. But the backlash to those campus revolutionaries also sparked the ascension of neoconservative intellectuals whose ideology has shaped the nations political agenda for decades.Professor Berns would have insisted that there was nothing neo about his own conservatism; as a doctoral student at the University of Chicago, he had been steeped in the classic conservative political philosophy of Leo Strauss, who taught there.But his embittered departure from Cornell in 1969 inspired a growing cadre of disaffected progressives and lapsed conservatives who blamed permissive liberalism for many social ills.Tyranny is the natural and inevitable mode of government for the shameless and self-indulgent who have carried liberty beyond any restraint, natural and conventional, Professor Berns later wrote.Jacob Heilbrunn, the editor of the magazine The National Interest and author of  said of Professor Berns: He would passionately condemn liberals at Cornell for what he saw as spinelessly truckling to a militant black student uprising, and the event marked him for the rest of his life, as he recalled the breaks with faculty members whom he never spoke to again. He became a leading neoconservative, a critic of liberalism and the universities, but also viewed the hard-right social conservatives of the Republican Party with skepticism. Challenging doctrinaire liberalism, Professor Berns defended limits on pornography and offensive speech, maintained that capital punishment was neither cruel nor unusual for heinous crimes, derided the efficacy of world government and championed the Electoral College and patriotism, but he also defended dissent.A single theme undergirded his philosophy: The purpose of law is and must be to promote virtue.Much of his writing reflects the classical view that democracy depends on the character of the citizens, so their opinions and beliefs, their personal habits and degree of self-discipline  in a word, their virtues  will matter to the prospects of democratic government, , a professor at George Mason University Law School, wrote on the Foundation for Constitutional Governments website.But Berns also acknowledged  indeed, often emphasized  that early modern thinkers (notably Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Adam Smith) had tried to place politics on a new foundation, he added, and the American Founders largely embraced the new approach, with its promise of reducing religious conflict and enlarging opportunities for the creation of wealth.Professor Berns was born on May 3, 1919, in Chicago. He attended Reed College in Portland, Ore., and the London School of Economics and received a bachelors degree from the University of Iowa. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he worked as a waiter in Taos, N.M., where he befriended Frieda Lawrence, the widow of D. H. Lawrence. Taking her advice, he pursued an academic rather than a literary career.In 1951, he married Irene Lyons, who survives him, along with his daughters, Elizabeth Fradkin and Emily Heyser; a son Christopher; and six grandchildren.He earned his doctorate at the University of Chicago and taught at Louisiana State University and Yale before going to Cornell in 1959. He left 10 years later, after the faculty, having jettisoned every vestige of academic freedom, Professor Berns said, reversed itself and granted amnesty to black students who had seized the student union building. Some denounced dissenting professors as racists and threatened them with violence.He taught at University of Toronto until 1979, then moved to Washington to teach at Georgetown and conduct research for the American Enterprise Institute. In 2005, he received the  from President George W. Bush.After the Cornell protest, one demonstrator, Thomas Jones, sent Professor Berns an apology, but he never responded, according to an account by , a professor at the University of Wisconsin.Mr. Jones acknowledged the other day, though, that years later, after he became the president of TIAA-CREF, a financial services company and provider of retirement services in the academic, research, medical and cultural fields, he received a sardonic congratulatory note from his former professor.First you wanted to kill me, the note from Professor Berns said.

{"body": "WASHINGTON   A tax on medical devices, imposed by the Affordable Care Act, has become a prime target for Republicans, some Democrats and a small army of lobbyists for the industry. But a new report from the Congressional Research Service challenges economic arguments that are being made to justify repealing the tax.Critics of the tax say it is destroying jobs and encouraging manufacturers to move operations overseas. Repealing it is a priority for Republicans on Capitol Hill.But in its report, the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, said that many of the concerns were unfounded.The effects on jobs, research and company profits are relatively modest, the report said. As a result of the tax, it estimates, 47 to 1,200 workers could lose their jobs. They account for one one-hundredth to two-tenths of 1 percent of jobs in the industry.These relatively modest effects occur partly because the tax is relatively small, the report said.In addition, it said, innovation and research would be minimally affected.The tax, which took effect in 2013, is equal to 2.3 percent of the sale price of a medical device and is expected to raise $29 billion over 10 years. It applies to products like  machines,  scanners, pacemakers, artificial hearts and artificial hip and knee joints.Most of the tax will be passed on in the form of higher prices, the report said, but the effect on the price of health care will most likely be negligible because of the small size of the tax and small share of health care spending attributable to medical devices.The effects on output and profits of medical device companies will also be minor, the report said.Studies commissioned by the medical device industry project larger effects, with a loss of 30,000 to 40,000 jobs or more. But the Congressional Research Service said the authors of these studies had often overlooked the fact that about half of output is exempt from the tax.The law exempts eyeglasses, ,  and other devices that are purchased by the general public at retail for individual use. These include  kits, adhesive bandages, wheelchairs and portable oxygen concentrators.Tax-exempt products in the American market account for about 20 percent of the industrys production, the report said. Sales of devices for export are also exempt, and they account for 38 percent of output, it said.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, strongly supports the repeal of the tax and said he trusted data from device manufacturers showing that it was a job-killer. Leading Democratic proponents of repeal include the senators from Minnesota, which is home to a thriving device industry. Last week, on the first day of the new Congress, Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota, introduced a bill to repeal the tax, and it immediately gained 258 co-sponsors, including 29 Democrats.The House passed legislation to repeal the tax in 2012, in 2013 and again in September. The Senate endorsed repeal as part of a nonbinding budget blueprint that it adopted in 2013.President Obama has threatened to veto legislation to repeal the tax, in part because its passage could embolden those who are trying to roll back other taxes and fees that finance coverage under the . Whether Congress would sustain a veto is unclear.The Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade group, said the analysis by the Congressional Research Service was fundamentally flawed.It simply ignores the facts of what is happening in the industry, said David H. Nexon, the associations senior executive vice president. All over the country, companies are reporting layoffs or forgone hiring for tens of thousands of workers as a result of the tax.A survey by the industry shows that one-third of medical device companies have reduced their research budgets in response to the tax, Mr. Nexon said.Patients will be the losers, he said, because they will have fewer lifesaving and life-enhancing treatments.Supporters of the tax said that device manufacturers, like insurers and drug companies, stood to benefit from the expansion of coverage. But the medical technology association said the increase in demand for devices so far appears to be small or nonexistent.Republicans said the tax had encouraged device companies to shift jobs and production operations overseas. But the report said that the tax should have no effect on production location decisions, since both domestically manufactured and imported medical devices are subject to the excise tax.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "ROBERT PEAR", "title": "New Analysis Challenges Arguments for Repealing Tax on Medical Devices - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/tax-has-modest-effects-on-medical-device-makers-report-says.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "ATLANTA   For the second time in less than a month, lawyers for former Gov. Don E. Siegelman of Alabama on Tuesday took his corruption case into a federal courtroom in an attempt to speed his eventual release from prison.During arguments before the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, a lawyer for Mr. Siegelman, Clifford M. Sloan, said allegations of misconduct by a prosecutor merited further exploration. He also said the judge who presided over the former governors 2006 trial had erred in applying federal sentencing guidelines.The questions raised in the appeal go to the very heart and core of the fairness of the prosecution and imprisonment of Mr. Siegelman, Mr. Sloan, who until recently was the Obama administrations special envoy for the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay, told the three-judge panel here.But a Justice Department lawyer, John-Alex Romano, insisted that Judge Mark E. Fuller had imposed an appropriate prison sentence  78 months  and that the United States attorney at the beginning of the inquiry, Leura Canary, had sufficiently honored her pledge to recuse herself from the case.Mr. Siegelman was  of charges stemming from his role in what prosecutors described as a bribery scheme that funneled $500,000 from Richard S. Scrushy, the chief executive of the HealthSouth Corporation, to a campaign supported by Mr. Siegelman. In exchange, the government said, Mr. Siegelman named Mr. Scrushy to a state regulatory board.Mr. Siegelman and his supporters contend that his prosecution was orchestrated by Republicans to hobble Alabamas once-dominant Democratic Party. A central tenet of their claim has been that Ms. Canarys husband consulted for a Republican campaign, and that the couple stood to benefit financially from Mr. Siegelmans legal troubles.Ms. Canary recused herself from the case in 2002, but Mr. Siegelmans lawyers, relying in part on a whistle-blowers letter, said her recusal was more ceremonial than practical.When the boss of the office is weighing in, thats control, Mr. Sloan said as he asked the appeals court to allow Mr. Siegelmans lawyers to examine documents that might show the extent of Ms. Canarys involvement.Let some sunshine in, Mr. Sloan said.In his own turn before the judges, Mr. Romano said that the whistle-blower was a paralegal with strained credibility. He also said that, after Ms. Canary recused herself, her involvement in the case had been minimal. (The 11th Circuit previously rejected an appeal by Mr. Scrushy that focused on Ms. Canarys activities.)But David M. Ebel, a senior judge on the panel, pressed Mr. Romano as to why the government had refused to agree to a round of discovery about Ms. Canarys role in the prosecution.Why not allow a discovery request limited to emails involving Ms. Canary? asked Judge Ebel, who was visiting from the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, based in Denver.Prosecutors, Mr. Romano said, had no legal reason to subscribe to such a plan. The government is simply holding the other side to its burden, he said.Mr. Siegelman, who did not attend Tuesdays hearing,  when a Federal District Court judge denied his bid to be released from prison while his appeal is pending.On Tuesday, with Mr. Siegelmans scheduled release more than two years away and the former governors wife and son looking on from the gallery, Mr. Sloan said, Every month, every day matters tremendously to his family.The panel, which also included Senior Judge Peter T. Fay and Judge Jill A. Pryor, did not indicate when it would issue a ruling.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "ALAN BLINDER", "title": "Lawyers for Don Siegelman, Ex-Governor of Alabama, Again Seek His Release From Prison - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/lawyers-for-don-siegelman-ex-governor-of-alabama-again-seek-his-release-from-prison.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "WASHINGTON   Senator Shelley Moore Capitos optimism about winning a seat in the Senate is tempered by another reality.Theres a real sense that we have to prove ourselves, Ms. Capito, a Republican, said. In November, voters in West Virginia gave Ms. Capito a promotion from her House seat to one in the Senate that brings more staff members, more influence within her state and more power to help it in Washington.Freed from re-election chores until 2020, she gladly accepts this advice from her retired Democratic predecessor Jay Rockefeller: Dont start campaigning right away.Yet Ms. Capito recognizes something else about this moment, for herself and fellow Republicans. It carries responsibility, she said.The question is how much that responsibility changes the instincts, habits and calculations of a party that, when it comes to governing, has grown so deeply accustomed to saying no. The answer will determine whether the next two years bring any relief from the partisan inertia of the past four.Sixty years ago, William F. Buckley Jr.  for the conservative movement as well as his new magazine, National Review: It stands athwart history, yelling stop. Then, the movement represented just one element of Republican politics, and not the dominant one.That changed in the era of President Ronald Reagan, who declared that , not the solution to Americas woes. Republican leaders who dared buck that formula since  the elder President George Bush by raising taxes or President George W. Bush by expanding  and bailing out Wall Street  have faced increasing dissent.Antigovernment fervor peaked in the  resistance to  and his agenda, setting off a debt-limit crisis in 2011 and a government shutdown in 2013. Last week, it drove the  to the re-election of Speaker John A. Boehner, whom some conservatives accuse of insufficient zeal in battling the White House.Yet . And along with Senator Mitch McConnell, the new majority leader, Mr. Boehner has signaled a more assertive approach to making Congress work, even with Mr. Obama.Recent history points to possibilities for cooperation on initiatives the Republicans strongly favor that the Democrats could prove unwilling to block.The 1986 midterm elections, for example, gave Democrats full control of Congress for Reagans last two years in office. The president and lawmakers enacted a plan  repealed the next year after public protests  to create catastrophic care coverage under .The 2006 midterms gave Democrats the House and Senate for the last two years of Mr. Bushs second term. , and he signed, an increase in the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour. Ms. Capito, as a House member from one of the poorest states, joined 81 other Republicans in voting yes.Novembers elections produced a similar alignment, with party roles reversed. But the formula for successful legislation works only if Republicans push priorities that Mr. Obama can ultimately accept. Those do not include negation of signature White House achievements like the .Are there any priorities the president and Republicans can agree on? Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, is not sure. Their agenda is an anti-Obama agenda, he said.Last year, House Republican leaders quashed a tax overhaul plan offered by Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, when he was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. But that was before Republicans increased their leverage by gaining control of the Senate.It could change behavior, said Tom Daschle, the Democrat and former Senate majority leader from South Dakota.At a minimum, Mr. Daschle expects Republican leaders to push for the orderly passage of annual spending bills. That alone would amount to a significant step in reducing Congresss dysfunction.Ratification of the Obama administrations forthcoming Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact represents the single most obvious target. Trade expansion remains a core tenet of Republican economic philosophy, notwithstanding some intraparty populist dissent.Ms. Capito hopes her party can do more business with the White House than that. She and other Republicans support the  oil pipeline. Mr. Obama favors various incentives for alternative energy that Republicans oppose, and he has signaled that he is open to negotiating on  while threatening to veto legislation requiring him to approve it.I dont think thats bad for either one of us, Ms. Capito said.She knows Mr. Obama has no intention of abandoning the new carbon emission regulations that coal-producing states like West Virginia loathe, or acquiescing in the dismantling of his . But she noted that a constituent who recently stopped her in the grocery store asked her simply to do something about Obamacare.She didnt say get rid of it, Ms. Capito said.Congressional Republicans and the president have both embraced the idea of a corporate tax overhaul that lowers the 35 percent top rate, but they remain far apart on details.But Mr. Obamas call for a tax overhaul plan that increases infrastructure spending hardly sounds hostile to Ms. Capito. Another constituent at that grocery store asked her to help rural communities gain more Internet access, one of Mr. Obamas oft-mentioned infrastructure goals.Ms. Capitos father, Arch Moore, who  last week, made highway improvements a centerpiece of his three terms as West Virginias governor. She said his approach to working with a Democratic-controlled Legislature was: If you are standing still, you are losing ground.Trent Lott, the former Senate Republican leader from Mississippi, goes so far as to say Republican control of Congress changes everything in Washington. Some still nurture dreams of the elusive grand bargain in which Republicans accept higher taxes if Mr. Obama and Democrats agree to curb Medicare and  spending.Even in these sunny early days, Ms. Capitos optimism is not that large.Before we run five miles, she said, we have to prove we can run one.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "JOHN HARWOOD", "title": "For G.O.P., Precedent to Cooperate and Shed Its Party of No Label  - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/recent-history-hints-at-the-discovery-of-common-ground-in-washington.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "WASHINGTON   One by one, Senator s fellow prisoners from the Vietnam War have been dying, and at 78, he said, he is aware more than ever that his time will come, too. Every single day, he mused in an interview, is a day less that I am going to be able to serve in the Senate.But no one should think that this reminder of his own mortality has tamed Mr. McCain, the bellicose Arizona Republican. If he had his way, the United States would have ground troops in Syria, more troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a steady supply of arms going to Ukraine.Now, six years after losing the presidential election to Barack Obama, Mr. McCain finally has the only job in Washington, other than being president, that he ever wanted: chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, overseer of the American military and the nations defense policy. The question is whether he will use his new clout (and ability to subpoena) to make war or some accommodation with the White House.McCain now has the power either to destroy the presidents national security policy or shape it constructively, said Leslie H. Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. This is the first step to see whether he is going to use his new power to clobber Obama as he has for the past six years, or whether he will use it to try to shape and improve Obamas policy.For now, despite hints that he is trying to reinvent himself from cantankerous Obama critic to elder statesman, Mr. McCain still seems to be in clobber mode. In an early assertion of his new authority, he said on Tuesday that he would push legislation to block Mr. Obama from sending detainees at the  military prison to Yemen.He said in an interview last Thursday that Mr. Obamas decision not to send more American troops to Iraq to thwart the Islamic State had put America at risk. That attack you saw in Paris? Youll see an attack in the United States, Mr. McCain said. He repeated his frequent assessment that the presidents foreign policy is a disaster and delusional. He said of course he would have made a better commander in chief.And he is still seething about his last visit to the Oval Office, in September 2013, when he and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, backed Mr. Obamas plan to intervene militarily in Syria  only to watch the president change his mind.Didnt even get the courtesy of a phone call, Mr. McCain said. When somebody looks you in the eye in the Oval Office and says theyre going to do something, dont you take their word for it? I did. I took his word for it. And obviously I shouldnt have.In short, he said of Mr. Obamas foreign policy: Ive been right. Hes been wrong.For his debut as chairman, Mr. McCain is planning a series of hearings on national security strategy with a bipartisan cast of luminaries from administrations long past, among them former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, 91, and two former national security advisers: Brent Scowcroft, 89, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, 86.Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, said the president sees Mr. McCain as possessing a very important viewpoint to consult with, even if Mr. Obama rejects Mr. McCains interventionist stance. Mr. McDonough said Mr. McCain had influenced the Obama administrations foreign policy, although when he was asked how, he paused.The reason Im pausing, he finally said, is Im trying to give you a concrete example.Senior Senate Democrats say they respect Mr. McCain for his expertise and bipartisan deal-making on issues like immigration, and they hold out the possibility that Mr. McCain will do more on the Armed Services Committee than browbeat Mr. Obamas nominees during confirmation hearings, as he has in the past. There are some signs of change: Mr. McCain is an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Obamas nominee for defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, who is to appear before the committee in February.I sense he has found the place where his particular talents are most important and most useful to the country, said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the senior Democrat on the committee. Hes no longer on the quest to be president, hes not being distracted by a steppingstone to the next thing, and he feels hes taking over at a crucial time to shape the policy of the United States.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Mr. McCain had an important role. People know his personality, and they know how passionately he feels, and they know he sometimes uses hyperbole, Mr. Schumer said. But its all very sincere and very heartfelt and based on a whole lot of experience. And I think in a world of terrorism, even when people dont agree with him, theyre sort of glad hes there.For Mr. McCain, a former Navy pilot and the son and grandson of admirals, running Armed Services is the fulfillment of a lifelong political aspiration, said Mark Salter, a longtime adviser to Mr. McCain and co-author of several of the senators books.Mr. McCain, in a sense, grew up on the Armed Services Committee. In 1977, four years after his release as a prisoner of war in Hanoi, the Navy assigned Captain McCain to be its Senate liaison. He traveled around the world with committee members like Gary Hart, a Democrat who later ran for president, and William S. Cohen, a Republican who became defense secretary under President Bill Clinton. John G. Tower, the committee chairman and a hawkish Texas Republican, became like a second father to Mr. McCain.It was Tower who inspired him to run for office and get into politics and get out of the military, said Rick Davis, Mr. McCains longtime strategist. So to have the job that Tower had  thats a big deal to him. Thats full circle.Mr. Tower, who died in 1991, still inspires Mr. McCain today. Of his plan to hold hearings to explore Americas place in the world, Mr. McCain said, Thats a page out of Towers book.As chairman, Mr. McCain has said, he will push to end the across-the-board budget cuts for the Pentagon known as sequestration, and he wants changes made to cut waste in the militarys procurement system, which has the defense industry on edge. And by using his new platform to call attention to global threats, he hopes to create a favorable climate for a Republican to win the White House in 2016. On Tuesday, Mitt Romney, who is considering another run, called Mr. McCain for advice.A year ago, before the beheadings, national security was a very low priority for the American people, Mr. McCain said. Now its a very high priority, and that was what Reagan did when he defeated Jimmy Carter. National security, peace through strength, became a very important phrase.Having tangled with Republican budget hawks (he once called Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky wacko birds), Mr. McCain is buoyed by the recent election of several military veterans: Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Joni Ernst of Iowa. He has maneuvered to put them all on his committee, in hopes of bolstering what he calls the internationalist wing.If Mr. McCain runs for re-election in 2016, as he says he is likely to do, he expects a  challenge. If he wins a sixth term, Mr. McCain will be 86 at the end of it, so friends say that race will probably be his last.I think John sees the next six years, really the next eight years, as the chance to close it out strong, said Jack Keane, a retired Army general and close friend to Mr. McCain. Mr. Graham, who is Mr. McCains closest friend in the Senate, said that Mr. McCain is looking at his legacy and is hopeful about working with Democrats to reform business practices at the Pentagon.He wants to be the guy who did the hard things, Mr. Graham said.Mr. McCain is not particularly interested in talking about legacy. But he did say that he has been hit hard by the deaths of fellow war prisoners, men he considered brothers. So he is feeling a new sense of urgency, he said, to jam-pack his schedule and make the most of his time.He said he had already decided on an epitaph for his tombstone: He served his country.\"", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "SHERYL GAY STOLBERG", "title": "At 78, McCain Savors a New Dream Job in the Senate - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/politics/john-mccain-78-and-untamed-savors-senate-dream-job.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "CHICAGO   Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan appointed a new emergency manager on Tuesday to oversee the Detroit Public Schools, the fourth such state-assigned manager to lead the struggling system since it was deemed in serious financial trouble in 2009.While the city of Detroit itself emerged late last year from emergency management and the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nations history, some city and state officials worry that the woes of its public schools threaten to slow efforts to remake Detroit and lure desperately needed new residents.And so, while Mr. Snyder announced that the public schools would remain under the oversight of an appointed manager despite opposition from some school leaders who say control should be returned to the local authorities, he also made it clear that his administration and other officials would soon weigh broader changes for a school system that has wrestled with declining enrollment, disappointing test scores and financial deficits.This is about making sure we have a great city, Mr. Snyder said in a news conference in a Detroit school, seated between the departing emergency manager, Jack Martin, and the arriving one, Darnell Earley.Detroit is making a tremendous comeback in terms of an economic revival, Mr. Snyder said. But to have us have long-term success, to have a truly great city, we need an educational system, a system where our students living in the city can get a wonderful education, where they can grow up in a neighborhood where they can say, I want my kids to grow up in that neighborhood. The Detroit Public Schools problems are longstanding and complex  more, apparently, than even three emergency managers over nearly six years of state control could fix. Over the past 20 years, the schools have lost students and funds to an array of forces: families moving away, policies that allowed students who lived in Detroit to go to suburban schools, the arrival of  in Detroit and its suburbs, and the transfer of 15 schools deemed to be failing into oversight by a state-led authority.While a spokesman for the schools, Steve Wasko, said the enrollment drop had slowed significantly in the past two years, the numbers are stark. About 47,000 students in kindergarten through high school attend Detroits 97 schools now, compared with 96,000 in existing schools in 2009.About 35,000 Detroit students attend charter schools in the city, officials said, and thousands more attend charters in the suburbs.On the financial side, too, the problems have barely improved. In 2009, the school system was found to have a $327 million deficit; this year, after managers vowed to carry out an array of cuts and changes, the deficit was estimated at $169.5 million.And while some in the citys schools say test scores and academic achievement have improved in the past few years, some national assessments of fourth and eighth graders show that fewer than half of the students are considered proficient in math and reading.The data are devastating, said Amber Arellano, executive director of the , an education advocacy and research organization based in Royal Oak, Mich. Theres no other way to cut it. Its abysmal.Mr. Snyder had to decide immediately what to do about the future of the Detroit schools leadership. Under state law, a governing body can remove an appointed emergency manager after 18 months, and Mr. Martins time was to run out this week. Critics of state oversight had urged Mr. Snyder to return the schools to local control, asserting that the outside oversight was undemocratic and impractical; a fourth emergency manager would be no more capable of fixing things than the three before him had, they said.State officials say the intent of Michigans emergency manager law has always been to swiftly steer cities and schools systems out of financial distress and back on their own, but Mr. Snyder said the problems in the school system were so great that an emergency manager must remain.Since 2013, Mr. Earley was an emergency manager for the city of Flint, and he worked as Saginaws city manager before that.We dont walk away from problems that took decades to get there, Mr. Snyder said. He added at another point: These issues didnt come about in the course of several 18-month periods. These conditions came about because of decades of challenges.Asked whether bankruptcy might be an option for the school system, as it was for the city, Mr. Snyder firmly said no. He noted that a group of community and education officials had begun meeting to sort through larger educational solutions for Detroit, and suggested that wider change might soon be ahead.Lets work through something that can be a better answer in terms of a longer-term answer, Mr. Snyder said.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "MONICA DAVEY", "title": "Michigan Governor Names Fourth New Manager for Detroit Schools - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/governor-names-fourth-new-manager-for-detroit-schools.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},

California Democrats are blessed to have a deep bench of talent, and I will decide soon based on what I think is the best way to continue the hard work we have already started together.Representative Loretta Sanchez, an Anaheim Democrat who entered Congress in 1997, also announced that she was seriously considering a run for the seat next year.Ms. Harriss , posted on a new campaign website, came a day after the California lieutenant governor, , who was widely viewed as the other major Democratic contender for the seat, announced that he was not going to run. Friends say that Mr. Newsom is more interested in running for governor when Jerry Brown retires in four years.Democrats here have long suggested that Ms. Harris and Mr. Newsom would avoid running against each other because both are such strong candidates, with their own fund-raising bases, and both come from Northern California.Ms. Harris, 50, is the daughter of a Jamaican-American father and an Indian-American mother. She won a second term as attorney general last year.The announcement by Ms. Harris seemed intended to establish an early dominance in the race and scare away potential contenders. On Saturday, Antonio R. Villaraigosa, a Democrat who is a former Los Angeles mayor, said he was seriously considering a bid for the Senate.Mr. Steyer, though, because of his personal fortune and his willingness to spend it  as he demonstrated by spending close to $100 million on behalf of pro-environment candidates in recent years  could prove a formidable opponent if he decides to run. The large team of political consultants from his environmental work would probably shift to help him in a Senate race, his aides said.In his statement, Mr. Steyer said that he thought California had made great strides in curbing greenhouse gas emissions, in no small part because of Governor Brown, a Democrat who in his inaugural speech last week called for a substantial effort to reduce emissions in California, including a  to reduce gas consumption by cars and trucks by 50 percent by 2030. Mr. Steyer suggested that the battlefront had moved east.But there is a different picture in Washington, Mr. Steyer said. There, strong interests oppose recognizing  and fight against the rights and futures of average Americans. And there they are winning. In her announcement, Ms. Harris made no mention of , suggesting one area of difference between the two if there is a race.I will be a fighter for middle class families who are feeling the pinch of stagnant wages and diminishing opportunity, Ms. Harris said. I will be a fighter for our children who deserve a world-class education, and for students burdened by predatory lenders and skyrocketing tuition.

While political circumstances change between campaign cycles, Mr. Romneys vulnerabilities, they say, are a constant.He got defined early, after he got through the nomination process, and they spent a lot of money to define him, said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, who praised Mr. Romneys passion and sense of purpose. And those issues are still there. That doesnt change, and that narrative is still out there.Nearly without fail, Republicans call Mr. Romney a decent man, and in public they prefer to speak delicately about him. But beyond the ritual accolades there is an unmistakable weariness, and in private, their criticism of him can be fierce.Mr. Romneys advisers dismiss the idea that his time has passed, bringing up an example sure to be repeated often if he does run.If thats the case, then Ronald Reagan never would have become president, said Eric Fehrnstrom, Mr. Romneys longtime spokesman. Reagan ran three times. Mitt learns from experience. If he does run, he will run his strongest campaign yet.(Mr. Reagan failed to win the Republican nomination in 1968 and 1976 before being elected president in 1980.)Even as they defend a potential candidacy, Mr. Romneys supporters underscore the gulf between grass-roots activists and the affluent network of donors, many of whom are business executives like him and are eager for him to undertake another campaign. The activists include conservatives who view Mr. Romney as too moderate and others who dislike him because they do not think he can win.Asked what would be different in a third campaign, Mr. Fehrnstrom said, Of all the potential candidates looking at the race, only Mitt Romney has proven that he can raise the billion dollars or more that would be needed, and he is the only one who is a proven vote-getter in a national race.Many early polls, which lean heavily on name recognition, show Mr. Romney leading the field when his name is included, a trend, one adviser said, that contributes to Mr. Romneys temptation. Part of that strength stems from his having led the ticket in 2012. But Mr. Fehrnstrom, in a barely veiled reference to former Gov.  of Florida, noted, Youve got two candidates with very high name identification.Mr. Romney and his lieutenants have been hastily contacting previous supporters, and even sounding out potential campaign managers, over the phone since the former Massachusetts governor revealed Friday to a group of contributors that he was considering another White House bid. A number of former aides and early backers have since indicated that they would support him again.But not a single current Republican senator has come forward to state support for the partys 2012 standard-bearer; three of them, separately, skirted the question the same way when asked about Mr. Romneys prospects: The more the merrier.Part of this owes to the reluctance of a politician to wager on somebody who has not even said he would run. With other potential candidates like Mr. Bush likely to enter the race, few elected officials want to commit this early. But the apprehension toward another bid by Mr. Romney extends beyond that.I would be surprised if he gets much traction, said Mark Lundberg, chairman of the Sioux County  in Iowa.Even some Iowa Republicans who have long backed Mr. Romney are not ready to say yes.I really need to know whats going to be different, said Renee Schulte, a former Iowa state representative, expressing concerns about how Mr. Romneys last campaign was conducted.Several Republicans interviewed this week, brought up another data point from 2012, which they said showed Mr. Romneys inability to connect: In a national exit poll conducted by Edison Research, among voters who said the candidate quality that most mattered to them was cares about people like me, President Obama won 81 percent to Mr. Romneys 18 percent.Iowa, which begins the primary process, illustrates the challenge. His poor showing in the 2008 caucuses there did severe damage to Mr. Romneys campaign, and he only reluctantly made an aggressive play to win shortly before they took place in 2012. He finished a close second, benefiting from divided conservatives and few serious rivals vying for the affection of establishment-aligned Republicans. Such a situation is unlikely in 2016, with the possibility that Mr. Bush and other Republicans such as Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky would also be vying for center-right support.Mr. Romney is better positioned in New Hampshire, where he convincingly won the 2012 primary and lives part of the year. People worked really hard for him and will do so again, said Jeb Bradley, a state senator there.Now that both Mr. Romney and Mr. Bush seem serious about considering bids, a sense of near panic has set in among strategists and donors torn between them. One Republican phoned a reporter at 11:13 p.m. Friday to make clear that a bundler, Patrick Durkin, who was reported as having attended Mr. Romneys gathering in New York actually supports Mr. Bush. Another contributor to Mr. Romney who backed him in both of his presidential races but also has ties to the Bush family replied curtly to an email about his plans should Mr. Romney run: We should talk offline and off the record.Each candidate will face the challenge of presenting himself as a fresh face, but that is especially difficult for Mr. Romney given his previous runs.How does he define what he is trying to do besides the fact he just wants to be president? asked Jim Dyke, a South Carolina-based Republican strategist, who is uncommitted. You can say what you will about Jeb, but at least he can effectively communicate about policies that are going to have a material impact on peoples lives. Romney has proven hes incapable of that.Matt Moore, the South Carolina Republican Party chairman, said Mr. Romney should not expect that Republican votes he attracted before would automatically be there for him again.South Carolina Republicans want Governor Romney to make his case compared to our other talented candidates, Mr. Moore said. No one is going to hand the nomination to Governor Romney on a silver platter.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "JONATHAN MARTIN", "title": "Third Chance for Romney? G.O.P.

{"body": "Al Bendich, a lawyer who successfully defended the right to free speech in two landmark midcentury obscenity cases  involving s poem Howl and Lenny Bruces nightclub act  died on Jan. 5 in Oakland, Calif. He was 85.The apparent cause was a heart attack, his wife, Pamela Bendich, said.Mr. Bendich was the last living member of the defense team in the Howl case, in which the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who had published and sold Howl in book form, stood trial in San Francisco in 1957.He was the sole defense lawyer in the first of Bruces obscenity trials, in San Francisco in 1962. Of the four obscenity trials Bruce would go through, the San Francisco case was the only one to end in an acquittal.Als work set a standard for freedom of artistic expression, the civil rights lawyer Michael E. Tigar said in a recent interview. Can you imagine a world in which it could be a crime to say words that you can hear on cable TV every night? Thats the world of the Sixties, in which there were legal prohibitions of the work of Henry Miller and Allen Ginsberg and comedians such as Lenny Bruce. So this was pathbreaking.More striking still is the fact that when Mr. Bendich wrote the brief in the Howl case  a document widely considered to have brought about the defense victory  he was just two years out of law school.Albert Morris Bendich (pronounced BEN-dick) was born in New York City on June 18, 1929. He earned a bachelors degree in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1950, followed by a masters in economics and, in 1955, a law degree there. He joined the staff of the Northern California American Civil Liberties Union in 1957.That June, the United States Supreme Court had issued a ruling in an obscenity case, , which deemed speech found to be obscene an exception to First Amendment protections.It said that this subcategory of sexually oriented expression is completely beyond the First Amendment pale  it can be absolutely criminalized, Nadine Strossen, a past president of the national A.C.L.U., explained in an interview. And that had an enormous chilling impact.Mr. Ferlinghettis trial was scheduled to start soon; he had been charged with publishing and selling obscene material after he offered copies of Howl for sale in the , the San Francisco institution he had helped found. The Roth ruling carried potentially grave implications for Howl, which was rife with sexually explicit language.It was incredibly important to provide persuasive arguments to the judge in that case about how he should construe the Supreme Court exception narrowly, Ms. Strossen said. And in such a way that it didnt extend to Howl or City Lights bookstore.Mr. Ferlinghettis trial  a bench trial, with no jury  opened in San Francisco Municipal Court on Aug. 16, 1957, before Judge Clayton W. Horn. The defense team was led by Jacob W. Ehrlich, a larger-than-life litigator given to sartorially extravagant courtroom presentations.He wore cuff links that at the time cost $25,000  more than $200,000 today  Ronald K. L. Collins, a professor at the University of Washington School of Law who has written about the case, said in an interview. (Sam Benedict, a television series starring Edmond OBrien and based on Mr. Ehrlichs career, was broadcast on NBC from 1962 to 1963.)Mr. Ehrlich, assisted by the civil liberties lawyer Lawrence Speiser, would handle most of the courtroom arguments.Jake Ehrlich spent most of our time reading from books like Moll Flanders to prove that this was nothing new, Mr. Ferlinghetti said in an interview on Tuesday. And we were left with only a few minutes at the very end for Al to make the constitutional points on which the case was won.It also fell to Mr. Bendich  the guy at the bottom of the totem pole, Mr. Collins said  to write the crucial document known familiarly as a brief but more formally as a legal memorandum. Judge Horn would consult it in drawing up his ruling.In Judge Horn, a Sunday school teacher in his spare time, the defense seemingly could not have drawn a less sympathetic jurist.Hes a man of the Lord, said Mr. Collins, whose 2013 book, Mania, written with David M. Skover, chronicles the Howl trial. Before this case, five women were in his court for shoplifting. And what was the sentence he gave them? They had to go and watch the movie The Ten Commandments   released in 1956 and then playing in theaters  write an essay and then come back and read it to him in court.On Oct. 3, 1957, Judge Horn delivered his opinion. That he produced a written opinion was noteworthy in itself.Rarely if ever will a municipal judge get a First Amendment case, Mr. Collins said. If you think about the kind of cases he gets  traffic violations, littering  hes not going to write an opinion in those cases.More than 4,000 words long, Judge Horns opinion concluded: In considering material claimed to be obscene it is well to remember the motto Honi soit qui mal y pense. (Evil to him who evil thinks.) Therefore, I conclude the book Howl and Other Poems does have some redeeming social importance, and I find the book is not obscene.The full opinion mirrored, in structure and substance, the central points that Al Bendich made in his memorandum, Mr. Collins said. He added: If you took into consideration Jake Ehrlichs arguments and Speisers contributions, it may well be that they disposed the judge to rule the way that he did. But then he needed the law to support it, and thats where Bendich comes in. To use a basketball analogy, they did the setup; he did the dunk.On Oct. 4, 1961, Bruce was arrested after a profanity-laden performance at a San Francisco nightclub. His trial began on March 5, 1962; Judge Horn again presided. The judges presence now seemed to augur well for the defense, but Bruce, ever the contrarian, demanded a jury trial.Bruce had this romanticized view of the people,  said Mr. Collins, also the author, with Mr. Skover, of The Trials of Lenny Bruce (2002). So Bendich has to do two things if he plans to win this trial. He has to have an array of witnesses  sociologists and others  to support the idea that certain forms of ribald comedy really further the importance of comedy. He also has to be very skilled in cross-examining the states witnesses. But he does one more thing that will prove to be extremely important: He writes jury instructions  the proposal that the judge considers, with that of the prosecution, before making his charge to the jury.On March 8, the jury heard Judge Horns instructions, which were, Mr. Collins said, either verbatim or very close to the ones Bendich gave him. Retiring, they deliberated for 5 hours and 25 minutes before acquitting Bruce.From newspaper interviews afterward, it was pretty clear that if it werent for those instructions, they were going to convict, Mr. Collins said.A resident of Berkeley, Mr. Bendich taught speech at the University of California there in the 1960s. Other seminal cases on which he worked included , a 1967 California Supreme Court case that ensured the constitutional rights of recipients of public assistance.At his death Mr. Bendich was a co-president of , an entertainment concern in Berkeley. He joined the company, originally Fantasy Records, in the late 1960s; in the 70s, after Mr. Zaentz began producing feature films, Mr. Bendich helped him secure the rights to Ken Keseys novel One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. The film version, co-produced by Mr. Zaentz, was released in 1975.Mr. Bendichs first marriage, to Hilary Solomon, ended in divorce. Besides his wife, the former Pamela Strebel, his survivors include three children from his first marriage, Nora Bendich Oldwin, Jonathan Bendich and Bridget Bendich; a daughter from his second marriage, Adrianne Bendich Keffeler; six grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.More than half a century later, the Howl case and Bruces San Francisco trial remain high-water marks in First Amendment law.If it were not for Al Bendich making the constitutional points that won the Howl trial for us, the prosecution of publishers who publish something that could be judged obscene would have gone on and on, Mr. Ferlinghetti said. But as it was, even though this was only a municipal court, this was a precedent that stood up all these years. It was no longer possible for some narrow-minded local authority to win a case against a book for obscenity.Throughout his courtroom career, Mr. Bendichs ready wit stood him in good stead. This was perhaps nowhere more evident than in the Bruce trial, where, in his opening statement, he discussed the time-honored role of comedy as a vehicle for social criticism.In his memoir, How to Talk Dirty and Influence People, Bruce recalled what transpired:We are going to prove, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that the nature of Mr. Bruces performance on the night of October the fourth was in the great tradition of social satire, related intimately to the kind of social satire to be found in the works of such great authors as Aristophanes, Jonathan SwiftThe prosecutor would have none of this. Im going to object, he interrupted.

{"body": "WASHINGTON   The  on Tuesday  that bank robbers are subject to mandatory 10-year sentences if they force others to accompany them, even for very short distances.The case concerned Larry Whitfield, a North Carolina man who in 2008 entered the home of 79-year-old Mary Parnell while fleeing the police after a botched bank robbery.Mr. Whitfield forced Ms. Parnell, who was upset and crying, to move with him from her living room to another room about nine feet away. She suffered a fatal heart attack, and Mr. Whitfield was captured not long after.The question in the case, Whitfield v. United States, No. 13-9026, was whether the short movement inside Ms. Parnells home was enough to subject Mr. Whitfield to prosecution under a 1934 federal law that calls for a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence when a criminal forces any person to accompany him during a bank robbery or while fleeing.Writing for the court, Justice  said the word accompany must be given its ordinary meaning.It was, and still is, he wrote, quoting old newspaper articles and other sources, perfectly natural to speak of accompanying someone over a relatively short distance, for example: from one area within a bank to the vault; to the altar at a wedding; up the stairway; or into, out of, or across a room. added examples from English literature, quoting passages from Charles Dickens and Jane Austen.Truly minor movements do not count, Justice Scalia wrote.It must constitute movement that would normally be described as from one place to another, he said, even if only from one spot within a room or outdoors to a different one.The 1934 law was enacted in reaction to a spate of bank robberies committed by John Dillinger and others. That history, Mr. Whitfield argued, should inform the courts understanding of the scope of the law.Justice Scalia rejected that argument.The Congress that wrote this provision may well have had most prominently in mind John Dillingers driving off with hostages, Justice Scalia wrote, but it enacted a provision which goes well beyond that.It does not seem to us that the danger of a forced accompaniment varies with the distance traversed, he said. Consider, for example, a hostage-takers movement of one of his victims a short distance to a window, where she would be exposed to police fire; or his use of the victim as a human shield as he approaches the door.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "ADAM LIPTAK", "title": "Supreme Court Takes Broad View on Hostage-Takers Penalty - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/politics/justices-take-broad-view-on-penalty-for-bank-robbers-who-hold-hostages.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "OLYMPIA, Wash.   Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, stepped to the rostrum in the ornate House chamber of the Capitol here on Tuesday and called for the biggest increase in new tax dollars in state history.The time of recession and hollowing out is behind us, Mr. Inslee said in his State of the State address to lawmakers. It is now time for reinvestment.Mr. Inslee is seeking $1.4 billion in new revenue as part of a nearly $39 billion budget plan that includes a new capital gains tax on the wealthy and a  carbon tax system he said would also reduce climate-altering pollution.The extra money, along with a projected $3 billion surge in revenue from existing taxes in a recovering economy, would be funneled heavily to one line item: education.Though Mr. Inslee, a former congressman who was elected governor in 2012, may well favor more money for schools in any case, seven ominous words are driving his tax-and-spending plan: sanctions and other remedial measures as necessary.That is the language of the Washington Supreme Court, the states highest judicial body, which last fall found the state in contempt for failing to outline a schedule, in dates and dollar amounts, to fix years of underfunding of schools. The justices issued a contempt order in September, after many failed promises by the Legislature, but held off enforcement until the end of the 2015 legislative session, which began Monday and is to last for 105 days.Imposing a penalty, if it comes to that, could well be a first in American politics, according to legal scholars who could not remember another example of a state high court holding an equal branch of government in contempt. No one is certain what might happen. The court was vague about what it might do, leaving just about anything on the table, and nobody can think of any relevant precedent. The court could, for example, order money deposited from state general funds into school accounts, legal scholars said, or impose fines or do something else altogether.Im still left wondering what a court can do to sanction a coequal branch of government where the sin ultimately boils down to the failure to vote for positive social and economic policy that satisfies the court, said Scott R. Bauries, a law professor at the University of Kentucky who studies state constitutions and education.Equally perplexing, he said, is that because the federal courts do not police disputes between branches of state government over the separation of powers, any challenge to the courts action could be appealed to only the justices themselves, who would be asked to second-guess whether they had acted within constitutional bounds.This order is pretty strongly worded, Professor Bauries said.The Legislature is divided but is already showing resistance to Mr. Inslees pleas. Republicans strengthened their control of the state Senate after last falls election, while Democrats retained a majority in the House. On Monday, less than 24 hours before the governors speech, the Senate changed its own rules to make any new tax harder to pass  requiring two-thirds approval of the chamber instead of a simple majority.This will make it much more difficult for Gov. Jay Inslee to pass his misguided proposals, said Senator Michael Baumgartner, a Republican who co-sponsored the rule change. By requiring broad support for taxes in the Legislature, we ensure that taxes will not be our first resort.Mr. Inslees tax package would be the largest ever in dollar terms, but in terms of percentage increase, some tax hikes have been much bigger. The states top education official, Randy Dorn, said he was braced for disaster. He said that even Mr. Inslees ambitious plans, were they to pass intact, might not satisfy a court that was clearly exasperated and tired of waiting.That, to me, is going to produce a constitutional crisis, he said.Court orders on education are common in state politics. Particularly since the 1990s, lawsuits have focused on state constitutions, which vary greatly in their requirements for education. Sixteen states, for example, simply require a system of free public schools, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Washingtons constitution is one of the most stringent  one of only eight that call education a fundamental, primary or paramount state obligation.That constitutional wording greatly strengthens the courts hand in its standoff with the Legislature, said Tom Ahearne, a Seattle lawyer who represented the parents, school districts and education groups  led to the contempt order. Ours is the most distinctive, period  the strongest, period, Mr. Ahearne said.How much new education spending would satisfy the court presents its own tangled set of questions. Some lawmakers say an increase in the range of $1 billion to $2 billion in the current budget would meet the courts demands, while others cited higher or lower numbers.Representative Norma Smith, a Republican who spoke for her party in a taped response to Mr. Inslees speech, said things were going so well for the state, with new growth in jobs and revenue, that tax increases might not be necessary at all.Yes, we must rectify the failure of the past, she said. But putting more money into the system must not be our only response.Mr. Inslee, in his speech, said that more money was not the only goal. Washingtons tax system  with no income tax and a heavy reliance on sales taxes  is also deeply unfair, he said, because lower income people pay a higher proportion of their income than do richer residents. His proposal for a 7 percent capital gains tax would affect less than 1 percent of the states taxpayers, he said.We can work toward a fairer tax system, and we should, Mr. Inslee said.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "KIRK JOHNSON", "title": "Washington Governor Seeks New Taxes as a Court Order Looms - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/washington-governor-seeks-new-taxes-as-a-court-order-looms.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "ATLANTA   Faced with a jury that was deadlocked, a South Carolina judge declared a mistrial early Tuesday in the proceedings against a former police chief charged with murder in the 2011 killing of an unarmed black man.The judge, Edgar W. Dickson, made his ruling about 2 a.m. after he had urged jurors to reach a consensus about the guilt or innocence of Richard J. Combs, who at the time of the shooting was police chief in Eutawville.The lead prosecutor, Solicitor David M. Pascoe Jr., said Tuesday that he expected to seek a new trial and would make a decision within weeks.The trial was the latest courtroom test for a police officer while the country wrestles with controversies about the use of lethal force by the authorities. Still, although Mr. Combs is white and the victim, Bernard Bailey, was black, the trial did not involve blatant allegations of racially motivated police misconduct similar to those that have swirled around the deaths of unarmed black men in Missouri and New York.During the trial, Mr. Combs had insisted that he fired three shots only when he feared that Mr. Bailey, who had an outstanding warrant, had decided to use his Chevrolet Silverado pickup as a weapon against him. By the early hours of Tuesday, it became clear that his defense had resonated with at least a fraction of the Orangeburg County jury of nine women and three men.Prosecutors had tried to depict Mr. Combs as a spiteful officer who overstepped his authority in Eutawville, a town of about 300 residents southeast of Columbia. We put up a really good case, Mr. Pascoe said. Nine jurors thought that the defendant was guilty.A lawyer for Mr. Combs, John OLeary, said he would meet with Mr. Pascoe to try to figure something out, but he said previous plea negotiations had faltered because of the defenses assertion that Mr. Combs had acted in accordance with his training as a police officer.Youve got to be able to say you did something wrong, and I honest to God dont know what he did wrong, said Mr. OLeary, a former director of the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy.Despite the absence of race-centered allegations, Mr. OLeary said that the outcome was a reflection of deep divisions within both the jury, which comprised seven blacks and five whites, and the larger community.Its pretty clear that it broke down on racial grounds, and thats sad, he said. Ive lived here a long time, and Ive never seen that problem before.By every account, Mr. Bailey and Mr. Combs met for the first time in March 2011, after Mr. Combs stopped Mr. Baileys daughter for a broken taillight. Mr. Bailey went to the scene and, according to Mr. Combs, was belligerent.Although Mr. Bailey was not arrested during that early-morning stop, Mr. Combs sought a warrant for obstruction of justice. A judge approved the request, but Mr. Combs did not try to serve it for more than a month. Instead, he said, he planned to arrest Mr. Bailey on the day when his daughter would make a court appearance about the traffic infraction.But Mr. Bailey visited the Town Hall on May 2, a day before his daughters court date, to discuss the citation, and Mr. Combs decided then to attempt an arrest. Mr. Bailey, described by witnesses as angry and stunned, tried to leave without being detained.According to Mr. Combs, Mr. Bailey shoved him away during a subsequent skirmish in the Town Halls parking lot.After Mr. Bailey started his trucks engine and shifted the truck into reverse, Mr. Combs said, I thought I was going to die. I thought I was going to be run over by the truck. He drew his handgun, a .40-caliber Glock, and fired; Mr. Bailey died at the scene.Mr. Combs also struggled on the witness stand, especially when he was asked to reconcile his account of how he obtained the arrest warrant. He also appeared ruffled when Mr. Pascoe clutched the handgun used in the shooting and posed questions like, How did Mr. Bailey feel when you shoved States Exhibit 1 in his face?The legal system has produced mixed results for Mr. Combs, who was  in December, shortly before he was scheduled to stand trial for official misconduct.The United States Department of Justice investigated the shooting but chose not to file charges. Separately, Eutawville officials reached a $400,000 settlement in a lawsuit brought by members of Mr. Baileys family.Mr. Baileys family said Tuesday that it was not dissuaded from our unswerving pursuit of justice.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "ALAN BLINDER", "title": "Mistrial Declared for Ex-Police Chief Who Killed Unarmed South Carolina Man - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/ex-police-chief-richard-combs-bernard-bailey-south-carolina.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "WASHINGTON   An incident Monday in which one passenger was killed and scores were hurt when smoke filled a Washington Metro car during a chaotic rush hour commute has raised new concerns about Washingtons aging, troubled transit system.The incident  the most calamitous on the Metro since a 2009  that killed eight riders and a train operator  was the most serious among a string of almost daily problems that befall riders of the system, like perpetually broken escalators, frequent delays and minor track fires. Earlier this week, the freezing weather cracked some aboveground rails in Virginia, causing extensive disruptions.Riders, transit advocates and elected officials expressed concern and exasperation Tuesday with the response to Mondays incident, including what appeared to be a chaotic evacuation of the affected train, which was headed from downtown Washington toward Virginia.Metro passengers deserve to know as soon as possible about Metros safety protocols for this type of incident, and those answers should be provided right away, said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, in a letter to Richard Sarles, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority general manager and chief executive.An ambitious capital plan to fix the system  the second-largest mass transit system in the nation  has been undermined by its unwieldy, multijurisdictional governing system in which everyone wants more services but few wish to pay for it, critics say.The smoke that filled the car was probably abetted by an electrical phenomenon known as arcing, caused when the insulators on the third rail are somehow compromised through deterioration or debris, investigators said. But the federal authorities said it would take months to figure out precisely what had happened.Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washingtons nonvoting congressional delegate, requested a congressional briefing for the region on the Metros safety and emergency response procedures. The delay in terminating the third rail caused what appears to be an unnecessary delay in rescuing riders trapped underground and without any information, Ms. Norton said in an email.The Yellow Line train was at LEnfant Plaza on its way to the Pentagon station about 3:30 p.m. Monday when smoke in the tunnel began filling the cars and the engineer was unable to back the train into the station, trapping some passengers in the cars. Many told reporters later that it had taken well over a half-hour for firefighters and the police to arrive. Witnesses described fear and panic as smoke billowed in and information was scarce, and some moved to evacuate themselves.According to preliminary findings from the , electrical arcing  essentially like static electricity escaping from the third rail that powers the systems trains  happened about 1,100 feet in front of the train.The train stopped in the tunnel, said Peter Knudson, a National Transportation Safety Board spokesman, but we dont know if that was because of a loss of power, or if the operator saw too much smoke to proceed. Investigators concluded their initial work at the scene Tuesday.The source of the smoke remained unclear Tuesday as there was no fire present, according to investigators. Something had to create smoke, said Augustine F. Ubaldi, a railroad engineering expert. Arcing is not unusual; arcing with smoke is.The key, he said, will be to find what caused it to burn, and is this a fluke or systematic and what can get done to prevent it in the future within reason.The agency that oversees the rail line was largely silent Monday. But on Tuesday, Tom Downs, the Metro Board chairman, released an open letter to customers in which he offered my deepest condolences to the family of the passenger who died yesterday following the incident on the Yellow Line. He also promised that once the cause of this incident is understood, we are prepared to take the actions needed to prevent this from happening again.The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which serves 3.4 million bus and train riders over a 1,500-square-mile region, was created in 1967 by an interstate compact serving Washington, suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia. Its board has eight voting directors appointed by the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission, the Washington City Council, the Washington Suburban Transit Commission and the federal governments administrator of general services. Funding comes from all four.This is the sort of thing that makes people roll their eyes, Charlie Bryant, who commutes between Washington and Rockville, Md., said as the Red Line was delayed at a station briefly Tuesday night. He said riding the Metro was better than sitting in traffic, but he added, There is always stuff out of service.Ricardo Wright, who commutes to suburban Maryland, also expressed frustration.

OToole Jr. of Federal District Court said that questionnaires filled out last week by prospective jurors confirmed, rather than undermined, my judgment that a fair and impartial jury can and will be chosen.Defense lawyers had asked that jury selection, scheduled to resume Thursday, be suspended for one month to allow passions inflamed by the Paris attacks to subside. Numerous media reports had noted similarities between the Paris killings and the bombings at the 2013 , which killed three and wounded more than 260. Defense lawyers said the comparison was prejudicial against Mr. Tsarnaev.After initial screening last week by a 28-page questionnaire, prospective jurors are to return to federal court in Boston starting Thursday for individual questioning. The judge said he expected jury selection to be completed within several days and for opening arguments to begin Jan. 26.The attacks in Paris began on the third of three days of jury selection in Boston. About 1,350 prospective jurors in the  filled out screening questionnaires; Judge OToole Jr. had planned to start the questioning of individual jurors on Thursday.The request for a delay was not the defense teams first; it had asked at least twice before for a delay, saying it was overwhelmed by the huge number of documents from the government. It also sought to move the trial out of Boston, saying Mr. Tsarnaev could not get a fair trial here. All such requests were denied, and jury selection began Jan. 5.In its request, the defense wrote: The supposed parallels included the fact that the suspects were brothers, that they reportedly were influenced by the lectures and writings of Anwar al-Awlaki, that they were homegrown terrorists, and that they attacked civilians in a Western city.Mr. Awlaki,  in Yemen, was  in 2011.Representative William Keating, Democrat of Massachusetts, was quoted by as saying: Im watching whats happening in Paris, and Im thinking of Watertown, a reference to lockdowns of suburban neighborhoods of Boston during sprawling manhunts to find the suspects after the bombing.These parallels so widely expressed cannot be lost on potential jurors, the defense wrote.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "KATHARINE Q.

{"body": "Gov. Chris Christie is preparing to take his first concrete steps toward a presidential campaign, with plans to set up a political action committee as early as the end of January that could help finance political travel and provide a fund-raising vehicle for would-be donors.But amid the aggressive, elbows-out jockeying between his likely rivals Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, Mr. Christie, one of the most mercurial and impulsive figures in American politics, has delivered a surprising message to his top supporters and donors: Relax.The governor and his team say that there is more than enough political money should Mr. Christie make a formal announcement in the spring.After several years as a likely presidential candidate, a relatively recent re-election campaign and a successful tenure as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, Mr. Christie already has the rudiments of a national campaign structure. And rather than push the partys top donors to commit quickly to Mr. Bush or Mr. Romney, they say, the rapid expansion of the field  which includes former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas  has left many inclined to take their time.The feedback Ive gotten from a lot of donors is that Mitts announcement created excitement, and so did Huckabees announcement, and now that everyone is back from the holidays, its creating kind of a pause among a lot of donors, said Ray Washburne, the departing finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, who has been tapped to lead fund-raising for a Christie campaign. Why rush?Mr. Christies quiet steps are taking place against a backdrop of bluffs and frenzied showmanship by the many would-be candidates in 2016, much of it prompted by Mr. Bushs plunge into the race last week. The list of likely contenders has grown to more than 20 Republicans from almost every region and of almost every ideological flavor, leaking to a hungry news media the details of seemingly every staff hiring, donor meeting and private phone call.But Christie supporters say that Mr. Bush and Mr. Romney are under more pressure than the New Jersey governor to show momentum. Mr. Romney was telling donors and former staff members as late as October that he would not run unless the other candidates failed to catch fire, meaning many of his loyalists were in the process of lining up behind other candidates before his surprise pronouncement last week. Backers of Mr. Bush, who has been out of elected office for a decade, have made it clear that they hope to scare other candidates out of the race by mustering prohibitive financial and institutional party support.During a trip to New York last week, Mr. Bush held 14 meet-and-greet events in three days, according to a person who saw his schedule, including meetings at KKR, a top private equity company, and Perella Weinberg, an asset management firm.Even so, Mr. Bush hasnt scooped up people yet in a significant way, said one top Republican donor on Wall Street, who has ties to Mr. Bush and Mr. Romney but has committed to neither. What hes doing is what Mitt does  hes rolling into town, having meetings without asking for money.Likewise, Mr. Romneys recent visits to New York did not yield firm commitments from many of the areas top Republicans, such as Woody Johnson, the owner of the Jets, or Paul Singer, the billionaire hedge fund manager.Mr. Christies supporters believe that there is plenty of time to woo them, and that many donors will spread their bets even after fund-raising begins in earnest  an assumption that will be sorely tested in the coming weeks as Mr. Bush and Mr. Romney pressure donors and bundlers to commit.Mr. Christies supporters also view Mr. Romneys entry into the race as poorly handled, even desperate, encouraged by his wife, Ann, and by advisers who made millions of dollars off Mr. Romneys last campaign.Details of a Romney meeting in New York City on Friday were leaked to the news media within hours, along with Mr. Romneys declaration to the guests that he was now considering a third run for the presidency. Some of those invited, who had been told that Mr. Romney merely wanted to catch up with old friends, were blindsided, according to people who attended or were briefed later on the gathering, and resented the implication that they were on board.Two of the attendees, Patrick Durkin, a banker at Barclays, and Alexander Navab, a senior executive at KKR, had already pledged their support to Mr. Bush.Mr. Christie, for his part, had long ago promised fellow Republican governors that he would not allow his presidential ambitions to overshadow his duties as chairman of the governors association. The new PAC is not scheduled to begin operations until after the final inauguration that Mr. Christie has committed to attending  the swearing-in next Wednesday of Larry Hogan of Maryland, one of the surprise Republican victors in last falls midterm elections. The PAC will probably be overseen by Phil Cox, a well-regarded political strategist who served as executive director of the governors association and recently formed his own political consulting firm.Mr. Christies top political adviser, Michael DuHaime, declined to comment.Instead of a frontal assault, the New Jersey governor has been appending largely private sit-downs with donors and other potential supporters onto his schedule of inaugurations  including those on his rivals turf. After attending the inauguration of Gov. Rick Scott of Florida last week, Mr. Christie traveled to Boston, where he attended both the swearing-in of the new Republican governor of Massachusetts and a private round-table event hosted by Seth Klarman, a prominent Republican donor.His approach is, I elected you, and with the folks that he did R.G.A. dinners with in those markets, its, lets talk about the next step,' said one Christie supporter involved in the events.Next week, Kenneth G. Langone, a founder of Home Depot, who is regarded as Mr. Christies foremost cheerleader in New Yorks business community, will host a dinner for the governor with prospective donors. Mr. Langone said in a recent interview that he welcomed the entry into the race of Mr. Bush and Mr. Romney, arguing that it would raise the quality of the Republican field.If we had all those guys run, we wouldnt have a circus like we had in 2011, Mr. Langone said. This is going to be healthy for the Republican Party and bring out a lot of Republican voters.A few days after Mr. Langones event, Mr. Christie will attend the Iowa Freedom Summit, co-hosted by Representative Steve King, a Republican popular with the states grass roots who also has a national profile among Tea Party adherents. That event will serve as the soft launch to the exploratory phase of Mr. Christies campaign, supporters said.The PAC will provide a destination for donors eager to get behind Mr. Christie and a payroll that will allow him to retain potential senior staff members for a presidential campaign. Mr. Bush has already established such a leadership PAC, Right to Rise, which shares its name with a new super PAC that has already begun soliciting contributions.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "NICHOLAS CONFESSORE", "title": "As 2016 Race Gains Steam, Christie Sees No Need to Rush - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/us/politics/as-2016-race-gains-steam-christie-sees-no-need-to-rush.html", "date": "JAN. 14, 2015"},
{"body": "WASHINGTON  The House on Wednesday voted to undo major provisions of President Obamas immigration policy, approving legislation that would revoke legal protections for millions of undocumented immigrants. The vote drew outrage from Democrats and led more than two dozen Republicans, many worried about the perception that their party is hostile to immigrants, to break away.The most contentious measures in the bill will most likely die in the Senate, where Democrats have said they will wage a  and some Republicans are likely to join in opposition. The White House has said President Obama will not sign any bill that blocks his executive actions on immigration.But the action in the House on Wednesday was a glimpse into how the new Republican-led Congress will navigate the divisive debate over the presidents immigration actions as lawmakers struggle to reach a compromise on funding the Department of Homeland Security. The department will run out of money at the end of February, and Republicans have said they will use the appropriations process as their vehicle for dismantling Mr. Obamas directives.In the House, 26 Republicans voted against an amendment that would effectively end Mr. Obamas 2012 order that allowed immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, a group known as Dreamers, to stay. The amendment passed by the thinnest of majorities, , with no Democratic Party votes.The overarching funding bill for Homeland Security passed , with 10 Republican defections. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, is expected to meet with his members over the next few days to discuss how to move forward with the bill, including whether they can amend it, strip out some of its more contentious amendments and send it back to the House.Republicans who supported the legislation said there was nothing cruel about their intentions. The debate was not about immigration, many of them insisted on Wednesday, but about the presidents exceeding his authority by rewriting immigration law on his own.By their votes last November, the people made clear they want more accountability from this president  enough is enough, said Speaker John A. Boehner, addressing the House chamber before the vote. By our votes here today, we will heed their will.Democrats accused Republicans of being indifferent to hard-working immigrants and said they were jeopardizing Homeland Security funds at a time when the country cannot afford to be caught off guard.Republicans have only been in control for a week and already they are picking an unnecessary political fight that risks shutting down the Department of Homeland Security, said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader. This is not a game and it is time for Republicans to take their responsibility to govern seriously, instead of playing to the most extreme voices in their party.The final outcome will not be resolved for weeks. Wednesdays vote was just the opening play by House conservatives, who wanted to be on record with a forceful response to the president.How many times the volleyball goes back and forth across the net, who knows, said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah.

{"body": "Washington  Attorney General  on Wednesday eliminated what journalism groups worried could be used as a loophole in the rules governing how and when prosecutors can subpoena journalists.For most of his time as attorney general, Mr. Holder oversaw a crackdown on government officials who talked to reporters about national security without permission, bringing more charges against people accused of leaking information than all of his predecessors combined. He also approved subpoenas for numerous journalists. But he recently said that the effort went too far at times.Mr. Holder first began reviewing the news media guidelines in 2013 during heavy criticism after prosecutors  and labeled a  for asking about classified information.  last February that made it significantly harder, though not impossible, to demand phone records, notes or emails from news organizations.Last year, Mr. Holder prevented the F.B.I. from portraying a reporter as a co-conspirator as a way to get around a ban on getting search warrants for reporting materials. That rule would have prevented the subpoena in Mr. Rosens case. He also made it harder for prosecutors to seize records in secret, as the did in the A.P. case. And he expanded that protection beyond phone records to cover emails and reporting work product, protections that did not exist previously.But those guidelines extended protections only to journalists engaged in ordinary news gathering. That phrase was not defined.With his revisions on Wednesday, Mr. Holder eliminated it.This updated policy is in part the result of the good-faith dialogue the department has engaged in with news industry representatives over the last several months, Mr. Holder said in a news release. These discussions have been very constructive, and I am grateful to the members of the media who have worked with us throughout this process.The rule revisions mean that as Mr. Holder prepares to leave office, he will leave behind internal rules offering journalists more protection from government intrusion than ever before. They were released the same week that the Justice Department decided, after a seven-year battle, , a reporter for The New York Times, to testify at a leak trial.Bruce Brown, the executive director of the , said that while he had not seen the final revision, he believed the decision not to call Mr. Risen to testify, coupled with the announced rule changes, suggested the Justice Department had turned a significant corner.It does reflect a significant change in direction for this attorney general as he leaves office, Mr. Brown said.He said the subpoenas of journalists and the high number of leak charges would always be part of Mr. Holders legacy, but what weve seen this week is also really significant.David E. McCraw, assistant general counsel at The New York Times, said the news organization supported changing federal law to declare that reporters could not be forced to identify their confidential sources. Enacting such a protection, known as a shield law, would take an act of Congress.Obviously, we would prefer that journalists have even greater legal protection for their confidential sources and news gathering activities, Mr. McCraw said. But the guidelines are an important element in assuring that subpoenas served on reporters and news organizations are the rare exception in D.O.J. investigations.The rule revisions were announced as the, entered its second day. He is charged with revealing details about a C.I.A. operation in Iran for Mr. Risens 2006 book, State of War.The Obama administration has defended its prosecution of suspected leakers, but journalists say the prosecutions have made it harder to cover national security beyond what it released in news statements and sanctioned leaks, such as those that told a glowing story about the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. Less favorable stories, such as those revealing prison abuses, waterboarding, warrantless wiretapping and drone strikes, relied on anonymous sources discussing classified information.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "MATT APUZZO", "title": "Journalists Win More Protection From Government Prosecution - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/us/politics/journalists-win-more-protection-from-government-prosecution.html", "date": "JAN. 14, 2015"},

Two correctional officers and eight prisoners were killed on Wednesday when a prison bus skidded off an icy highway overpass in West Texas, slid down an embankment and collided with a train, officials said.The bus was carrying inmates from a prison in Abilene to another in El Paso when the crash occurred at about 7:30 a.m. on Interstate 20 west of Odessa, said Brad Livingston, executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Another correctional employee and four other prisoners were injured and transported to Medical Center Hospital in Odessa.Its as bad as you can imagine, a battalion chief for the Odessa fire department, Kavin Tinney, told The Odessa American. In 32 years, its as bad as anything Ive seen.The prisoners were handcuffed together in pairs, according to media reports.On Wednesday afternoon, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team to Odessa to investigate.The overpass was slick with ice at the time of the crash, said Sheriff Mark Donaldson of Ector Country. The temperatures were near freezing, he said, and it was sprinkling when the bus ran into the side of a moving freight train.Four people who were taken to the hospital were in critical condition, and another person was in serious condition, said Jacqui Gore, a spokeswoman for Medical Center Hospital.It is with a heavy heart that we mourn the loss of those killed and injured this morning in a tragic accident, Mr. Livingston said in a statement.

{"body": "DENVER   To choose a jury in the trial of the in a packed Colorado movie theater, court officials mailed notices to 9,000 people in suburban Arapahoe County, casting such a wide net that residents ran about a one-in-50 chance of being tapped as potential jurors. An uncle, a father, husbands and friends of people who work in the prosecutors office received jury summonses. So did 12 people who are slated to be prosecution witnesses.The numbers speak to the huge scale of a murder trial set to begin next week, more than two and a half years after a gunman sprayed bullets into a crowd of people at a midnight screening of the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises.The defendant, , has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. After multiple delays, Colorado is bracing for the start of his trial, one of the most complicated and emotionally wrenching judicial proceedings the state has faced.I dont think there is anything like this in Colorado, or really much precedent for it in the country, said , an associate professor of law at the University of Denver and a former federal public defender. These mass shootings usually end in suicide or police killing the person. And even when they dont, it seems that the scale of the procedures is usually smaller.The 9,000 jury summonses sent out in this trial are far more than for most criminal trials, and even dwarf the pool of more than 1,300 potential jurors who have filled out questionnaires in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the defendant in the 2013  bombings.Mr. Holmess trial could sprawl over six to eight months, with jury selection alone lasting months. Scores of police officers, crime scene experts, witnesses, mental health experts and others are expected to present detailed testimony about the shooting in July 2012, the elaborate explosive booby traps that the police said Mr. Holmes left in his apartment and his mental state in the days and months before the shooting.It will be a deluge of details for jurors, ultimately focused on two questions: Was Mr. Holmes, a former neuroscience graduate student, legally sane or insane when he killed a dozen people and wounded more than 50 others? And if he is found criminally culpable, does he deserve to be executed?With jury selection set to begin Tuesday, people who survived the shooting or lost friends and family members have been weighing whether to face the gantlet of news cameras at the Arapahoe County courthouse and the grisly details that will emerge during the trial. Many will take the witness stand to recount how a movie theater became a charnel house of bullets, tear gas, screams and blood. Some plan to attend the opening and closing of the trial.Others, like Cody Hickman, 36, plan to stay away. Mr. Hickman, a father of four who is attending law school, was in an adjacent movie theater when the gunman slipped into the building through an emergency exit and opened fire.It is still hard to think about, and I dont want to go through the process of handling these thoughts in public, he wrote in an email.I have a visceral reaction when I see him, he said of Mr. Holmes, and would rather not give him any more of my happiness than he has already taken.The district attorney, George Brauchler, is , and prosecutors have said that Mr. Holmes acted with calculation and deliberation as he amassed an arsenal and plotted his rampage. Mr. Holmess lawyers admit he was the gunman but argue he was in the grips of a psychotic episode the night of the shooting.In their first public statement since the killings, Mr. Holmess parents, Robert and Arlene, expressed sympathy for the victims and their families, but insisted that their son is not a monster. He is, they said, suffering from a severe mental illness and should be institutionalized.We love our son, we have always loved him and we do not want him to be executed, his parents wrote in a Dec. 19 open letter. We also decry the need for a trial. A lengthy trial requires everyone to relive those horrible moments in time, causing additional trauma.His lawyers and parents say Mr. Holmes is willing to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life in prison to avoid a drawn-out trial. But Mr. Brauchler has shown no sign of reconsidering. After consulting with survivors and family members of the victims, he announced in April 2013 that he would seek the death penalty, saying that for Mr. Holmes, justice is death.The legal brambles of prosecuting a death penalty case have led to months of delays in the trial, as have two mental health evaluations of Mr. Holmes.Prosecutors after the first exam, saying the psychiatrist who performed it was biased, though the details of their contention  like so much in the case  have been discussed only in closed sessions and redacted from court documents. A second evaluation was completed in October. Its details and conclusions are still out of public view.For Marcus Weaver, whose right arm went numb for two years from a gunshot wound that night, going to the courthouse for at least part of the trial will be a small tribute to . He was sitting with his friend Rebecca Wingo when she was killed. He still wakes up regularly at 3 a.m. thinking about the chaos in the theater, and wonders what would have happened if he had been in a different seat.For more than two years, he said, survivors and family members of the dead have met with prosecutors and received updates on the trial. They were a regular part of Mr. Weavers life as he embarked on a new career speaking to church groups and prisoners about pain and forgiveness, and as he grappled with the depression and strain from that night.Mr. Weaver said that while he had forgiven Mr. Holmes and was philosophically opposed to the death penalty, he supported execution in this case.When you walk into a theater with an AR-15 rifle you give up your right to life, he said of Mr. Holmes.

{"body": "CAIRO   Former President  embezzled $17.5 million for personal expenses during his last eight years in power, according to billing statements cited as evidence in his only criminal conviction still standing: $5,455 for four La-Z-Boy recliners, $6,336 on a marble mosaic for a sons bathroom, $2,018 for a chess set, and hundreds of other items.Now, however, a Cairo appeals court has reversed the last guilty verdict. Citing procedural problems, Judge Salama Abdel Meguid ordered a retrial for the last of several convictions handed down in the aftermath of the 2011 uprising that ended Mr. Mubaraks rule.All of the previous convictions, including a guilty verdict for directing the killing of demonstrators, have now been dismissed or upended after a 2013 military takeover, granting Mr. Mubarak, 86, at least a partial rehabilitation.When a court ruling in November overturned his murder conviction and life sentence, the decision was widely seen as a sweeping repudiation of the 2011 uprising that forced him from power. Thousands braved draconian new penalties for public demonstrations and protested near Tahrir Square the night the verdict was announced. Security forces had already sealed off the square in anticipation, and they used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. At least two protesters were killed, and at least nine others were injured.The response on Tuesday was far more muted. During a brief, televised court session, Judge Meguid had scarcely announced the decision to send the case back for retrial before women in the courtroom erupted in celebration and drowned out his voice.The Egyptian state and private news media, almost all of it pro-government, covered the ruling only lightly. The Egyptian affiliate of the Qatari-owned Al Jazeera network had devoted extensive coverage to outrage at the previous successful Mubarak appeal in November, but Qatar has since agreed to shut down the station in an attempt to repair diplomatic relations with the military-backed government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi., an English-language online magazine, published the billing records showing details of the Mubaraks extravagant lifestyle, which might have enraged many Egyptians. The average household income here is about $4,090 a year, according to the most recent government figures. But few, if any, Arabic-language news outlets reported on the Mubarak expenses.There is no longer any legal reason for Mr. Mubarak to be detained. He remains inside a military hospital overlooking the Nile, where he was moved from prison for health reasons during his trials. But even before the reversal on Tuesday, he had already been detained for longer than his three-year corruption sentence, ostensibly entitling him to release.There may, however, be political reasons for Mr. Mubarak to stay out of sight, or for the authorities to keep him from public view. If released, he would become the first former president allowed to live freely and speak openly; all others left the post in military custody or died in office. Mr. Mubarak could publicly defend his tenure, criticize Mr. Sisis policies, rally his former loyalists in business, politics and government, or potentially even seek to influence a planned parliamentary vote  any of which could prove awkward for Mr. Sisi.Overturning the conviction, though, may remove some embarrassment for Mr. Sisis prime minister, . Mr. Mehlib was the chief executive of the state-run construction company under Mr. Mubarak, and the prosecutions court filings in the case charged that Mr. Mehlib had played a central role in helping the family embezzle money by falsifying expense reports.Prosecutors accused the Mubaraks of illegally charging the government for personal expenses  including utility bills, landscaping, home furnishings, refrigerators, other electrical appliances and kitchen supplies  and for a variety of private homes, as well as a public palace that was fraudulently transferred to their ownership.Many expenses related to five vacation homes that the family owned near the seaside resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, as well as a farm east of Cairo. The family billed the government for the design and furnishing of a private office in a luxury hotel complex for Mr. Mubaraks wife, Suzanne, and another office where their sons ran an investment business.Expenses also included the renovation of a private villa, the installation of an elevator in one home and a Jacuzzi in another, the construction of a new palace wing to accommodate the birth of a granddaughter, and the construction of a mausoleum for a grandson.Since the military takeover in 2013, however, the public demands to hold Mr. Mubarak accountable have largely gone silent. Military leaders remember Mr. Mubarak as one of their own, and the political will to bring charges against him has dissipated.Striking down Mr. Mubaraks murder conviction in November, Judge Mahmoud Kamel al-Rashidi struck a philosophical tone. To rule for or against him after he has become old, he said, will be left to history and the judge of judges.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "DAVID D.

Today more than ever, Israel is our true home, and the more numerous we are, and the more united we are in our country, the stronger we are in our one and only state.Israels president, Reuven Rivlin, told the Jews of France that we yearn to see you settle in Zion, but said immigration need not be due to distress, out of desperation, because of destruction, or in the throes of terror and fear.The land of Israel is the land of choice; we want you to choose Israel because of a love for Israel, he said. Dear families, aside the graves of your loved ones, we promise that we will continue to fight for your right to live as Jews  wherever you may be.The noon service, under a clear blue sky and warm sun, drew several thousand people to a hilltop cemetery called Mount of Rest, where, less than three years before, a  was held for three children and a rabbi killed in an attack by a . Many in the crowd were newcomers from France, the largest feeder country to Israel last year , almost twice the number in 2013.It could have been us, said Shany Braun, 17, who moved here in September and came to the funeral with 35 young Frenchwomen studying in a Jerusalem seminary. All our families are in France; its like our brothers.French flags were interspersed with Israeli ones on the citys main roads, and placards saying Jerusalem embraces the French people had been posted in various neighborhoods. Radio stations played French music.The parking lot where the service was held was ringed only by Israels blue-and-white Star of David emblem, and the mourners sang the Israeli national anthem.The French Embassy in Tel Aviv estimates that 130,000 to 150,000 French citizens are in Israel. The coastal city of Netanya has been nicknamed the Israeli Riviera, and plenty of patisseries and Francophone synagogues are there, as well as in certain neighborhoods of Jerusalem and the beachside towns of Ashdod and Ashkelon. French companies have set up call centers here, and   The Little Weekly  offers news nuggets and listings for housing and religious classes in the native tongue.Its easier for newcomers to be absorbed in the country because you can continue to live a part of the way of life in France, said Avi Zana, who arrived 35 years ago and runs an organization to help French immigrants settle here. Immigration is not like it was in the past; you dont leave everything behind you when you leave France. Today, you are constantly in contact.The fate of French Jewry has been a matter of intense debate since the 2012 murders in Toulouse. Some Jews say they feel unsafe wearing skullcaps or otherwise identifying themselves publicly in the face of what they see as rising anti-Semitism. At the same time, Frances  toward the , as well as its support last month for a United Nations Security Council resolution demanding an end to Israels occupation of the West Bank, has created a sense of political alienation for some.Mr. Netanyahu, who is seeking a fourth term as prime minister in March elections, came to the funeral after two days in Paris, where his every move seemed to stir controversy.Some news organizations  that President Francois Hollande of France had asked him not to join Sundays solidarity march in Paris for fear his presence would distract people from the larger message. Officials at the Elysee Palace and in Jerusalem denied this, saying the hesitation involved only security logistics.Mr. Netanyahu was skewered on social media for waving to the crowd during the march and from the second. Aides said that the wave had come in response to a shout, The people of Israel live, and that he had been invited to join other world leaders in front. Columnists who are relentlessly critical of the prime minister described his performance as crass, cynical and full of chutzpah.It is possible to maintain elementary rules of etiquette outwardly, and at the same time to act wisely in order to open the door to as many French Jews as possible, Ben Caspit wrote Monday in the Israeli daily Maariv.In the left-leaning newspaper  called Mr. Netanyahus response Pavlovian and warned, By encouraging mass emigration, Israeli politicians could very well be helping terrorist fanatics finish the job started by the Nazis and their Vichy collaborators: making France Judenrein, or free of Jews.The stay-or-go dilemma was an undercurrent at the funeral, where many of the mourners said they had relatives in France who were newly contemplating packing their bags. Expanding the slogan that has gripped the world since last Wednesdays killings at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, some mourners held signs that said, in French: I am Charlie, I am Jewish, I am Israeli, I am French, I am fed up.Family members lit torches next to the bodies, wrapped in Jewish prayer shawls. The victims were: Yoav Hattab, who grew up in Tunisia but was studying in Paris; Yohan Cohen, 22, who worked in the Hyper Cacher market and, according to , died while trying to disarm the gunman; Philippe Braham, 45, a teacher and father of four; and Francois-Michel Saada, 63, whose two children were among the new throngs of French-Israelis.All his life, he loved Israel, said Mr. Saadas son, Jonathan. He really wanted to live here, and he will. Hes here now, and Im sure hes really happy to be with you here.Mr. Brahams widow, Valerie, could not contain tears as she spoke about him as a perfect person and recalled that they had buried their 3-year-old son in Jerusalem four years ago.Today, he is with my son, she said, broken yet poised.

{"body": "The Michigan family of a former Marine incarcerated for more than three years in  has been receiving telephone calls and emails from that country proposing prisoner swaps for Iranians held in the United States, he said in a letter to Irans president made public by his relatives on Tuesday.The former Marine, Amir Hekmati, 31, said that he and his family had rejected the idea of such exchanges. He reiterated his contention that he is innocent and should be released.The letter also disclosed previously unpublicized details of Mr. Hekmatis confinement in Evin Prison in Tehran  including assertions of isolation in a 3-foot-by-3-foot cell for the first four months, and starvation and deception by Iranian officials  that the family had known but kept private.My family endured the most painful and horrific four months of their lives, wondering what became of me, he wrote in the letter, addressed to President Hassan Rouhani of Iran.It was the latest in a series of steps taken by Mr. Hekmati and his relatives to focus attention on his case, which has festered into another serious irritant in the estranged relationship between Iran and the United States.Last month, Mr. Hekmati  despondent over the apparent paralysis in his appeal, his ailing father in the United States and the poor conditions at Evin Prison  began a hunger strike, but  it after Iranian officials assured him that his case would be revisited.He was originally sentenced to death on an espionage conviction, but the verdict was overturned. He was then convicted of aiding a hostile country, meaning the United States, and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.Mr. Hekmati and his advocates have said that they believe his case is purely political. But his disclosure that others in Iran have been contacting his family to propose prisoner exchanges had not been reported.Family members declined to identify any of the Iranian inmates in the United States. A State Department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said officials were aware of reports that Mr. Hekmati had written recently to Irans president, but declined to comment on the specifics of the letter or any conversations held with Mr. Hekmatis family.The Obama administration has repeatedly called on Iran to release Mr. Hekmati and other Americans held in the country.For the past three years, my family has been receiving emails and phone calls from individuals within Iran proposing prisoner exchanges, even going as far as asking my family to lobby publicly for the release of these individuals, Mr. Hekmati wrote. Considering I have committed no crime and have no connections to these individuals, my family and I fail to see why we should have to lobby for their release or why I should have to spend the next 10 years in prison.There has been repeated speculation about possible prisoner exchanges to free Mr. Hekmati. American officials have denied that any discussion of such exchanges has occurred. But Iranian officials have made it clear that they believe an unspecified number of Iranian inmates in the United States should be released.The Justice Department has said that more than three dozen Iranians are in custody in the United States for a range of offenses, mostly fraud and drug charges.The ordeal of Mr. Hekmati, an American of Iranian descent from Flint, Mich., who served with the Marine Corps in Iraq, began after he went to visit his extended family in Iran for the first time in August 2011. He was seized soon after he arrived in Tehran.His relatives said the letter, in English, had been dictated by phone and given to Mr. Hekmatis Tehran lawyer this week to be sent to the president. It was unclear on Tuesday whether the letter had been delivered.It was the first time that Mr. Hekmati, who has written to other top Iranian officials, had appealed directly to Mr. Rouhani. Mr. Hekmati has also written to Obama administration officials.In a statement about the letter, Mr. Hekmatis family said it was deeply disturbed and shaken by revelations regarding Mr. Hekmatis treatment and conditions in Evin Prison.Despite assurances from prison officials that Mr. Hekmati had not been harmed, the statement said, it is clear that his recent appeals to both U.S. and Iranian government officials are a cry for help.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "RICK GLADSTONE", "title": "Ex-Marine Says Iranians Want a Swap to Free Him - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/world/ex-marine-says-iranians-want-a-swap-to-free-him.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "JERUSALEM  Chancellor  of Germany was right there next to the president of France on Sunday, marching through the streets of Paris for all the world to see  all the world, that is, except the readers of an ultra-Orthodox newspaper in .The newspaper, HaMevaser, altered a third-page photograph of the march to remove Ms. Merkel and other female leaders, setting off snickers and satire on social media.Ultra-Orthodox publications generally avoid pictures of women for reasons of modesty, and their intended audience has been known to scratch womens faces out of bus advertisements and to bar them from running for public office in their parties. But some people saw the deletions from the Paris photograph as a more serious sin.It is rather embarrassing when, at a time that the Western world is rallying against manifestations of religious extremism, our extremists manage to take the stage, Allison Kaplan Sommer  for Israels left-leaning newspaper Haaretz. She berated HaMevaser for denying the fact that in the wider world, beyond the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, women do stand on the world stage and shape events.Apparently deleted along with Ms. Merkel were: the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo; a European Union official; and Simonetta Sommaruga, the president of Switzerland.The altered photo, first pointed out by Walla, an Israeli news site, drew wide scrutiny. Rather than just blur the womens faces, HaMevaser tried to make it appear as though no women had been there to begin with. The results were far from seamless:  citing the discoloration of a mans face, a disembodied hand, a mysterious glove and an unexplained blur, and posted a comparison with the unaltered original.An Irish satirical news source, Waterford Whispers, responded by posting its own  featuring the same Paris street scene with three female leaders depicted, but no men.Newspapers catering to ultra-Orthodox Jews have been embarrassed before by their handling of news photographs depicting women. In 2011, Di Tzeitung, a Brooklyn-based publication,  a photograph to remove Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was then secretary of state, and another woman from a scene in the White House Situation Room.No one from HaMevaser could be reached on Tuesday, including the owner, Meir Porush, a former member of Parliament. The newspaper, established in 2009, publishes up to eight pages daily and 20 pages on Fridays, focusing on current affairs. Its Thursday section For the Home is aimed at women.Rama Burshtein, an ultra-Orthodox filmmaker whose 2012 movie Fill the Void won international acclaim, said in an interview that the alteration of the photo would make perfect sense to the newspapers readers.Its very, very, very, very, very hard for a nonreligious person to understand the purity of eyes, Ms. Burshtein said.

{"body": "BEIRUT, Lebanon   As the world focused last week on the attacks by Islamist extremists in Paris, hopes were fading for the latest effort to wind down the war in , a conflict seen as driving radicalization among Muslims worldwide.For months,  has been working to persuade government and opposition figures to attend preliminary talks in Moscow on Jan. 26 that are aimed at starting a new peace process. But in recent days, several leading opposition figures, apparently doubting s credibility as a mediator, said they would not attend, undermining the initiative.Chief among them was Moaz al-Khatib, a cleric from Damascus who is one of the few exiled figures who retains credibility among opposition fighters inside , and who had earlier urged colleagues to take the talks seriously. But he declared onthat he would not attend, saying, We dont have the conditions for the success of this meeting.The only other international proposal on the table  a freeze in fighting in the contested city of Aleppo proposed by the United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura  has yet to gain momentum, though officials continue to meet with the dozens of players who would need to agree even to that modest, incremental plan.As Syria increasingly becomes the worlds problem, all sides in the conflict have reason to re-evaluate their positions. Falling oil prices are putting stress on Russia and Iran, the main backers of Syrias president, . Another Assad ally, the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah, faces the prospect of a large population of Sunni refugees from Syria becoming permanent, altering the countrys sectarian balance of power.On the other side, the United States, though it has long called for Mr. Assads ouster, increasingly appears to see checking the growth of the Islamic State extremist group as a higher priority. Turkey, a major backer of the revolt against Mr. Assad, faces a growing burden from a refugee crisis that will only deepen as the conflict goes on.Inside the country, relatively moderate Syrian insurgents are losing ground to extremist groups like the Nusra Front and the Islamic State in the northern regions that were long their center of gravity. The government is depleting its manpower and increasingly relying on foreign Shiite militias and irregular forces.Yet these predicaments do not seem to have moved major players closer to compromise. The Syrian government seems to believe the world has decided that Mr. Assad is staying in power.The hard days in Syria are gone, and now we are getting out of the tunnel, Bouthaina Shaaban, a presidential adviser, told Lebanons Al Mayadeen television last week.At the same time, many armed opposition groups, as well as the main exile opposition coalition, refuse to discuss any political solution that does not involve Mr. Assad leaving.Many ordinary Syrians, on the other hand, while mistrustful of international powers they see as having abandoned them to their fate, are willing to try almost anything.Nasser al-Hariri, a top official in the Syrian opposition coalition based in Istanbul, said he had been surprised on a recent visit to southern Turkey to find many people involved in the opposition interested in exploring Moscows proposal. The coalition has been vociferously critical of the initiative.People were saying: Weve been trying the American approach for years, and weve gotten nothing. Lets try Moscow,  even at the expense of angering the United States and its allies, he said.Despite Russias alliance with Mr. Assad against the nearly four-year insurgency, some Assad opponents initially said they were ready to try out Moscows approach  a measure, they said, of the desperation that many Syrians on all sides feel over a war that has displaced nearly half the population and killed more than 200,000 people, with no end in sight.The momentum was lost, diplomats familiar with the planning say, when it became apparent that Moscow was allowing the Syrian government to cherry-pick its interlocutors, issuing invitations to individuals rather than to the various opposition groups.That led to the withdrawal of Mr. Khatib, as well as of a group led by Louay Hussein, an opposition figure from inside Syria who was recently arrested by the government.For now, the Moscow meeting is expected to go ahead, though its chances of making even modest progress currently appear limited.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "ANNE BARNARD", "title": "Syria Peace Hopes Dim Further as Opposition Rejects Moscow Talks  - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/world/middleeast/syria-peace-talk-hopes-fade.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "SEOUL, South Korea  South Korean prosecutors said on Wednesday that they had arrested a former member of a left-wing political party, now defunct, on charges of breaking the countrys anti-communist National Security Law over comments she made about North Korea.The case against the longtime activist, Hwang Sun, 41, comes amid deepening fears among government critics that the administration of President Park Geun-hye is abusing South Koreas National Security Law and a criminal ban on defamation to suppress freedom of speech.Last year, Ms. Hwang helped organize a series of joint lectures during which she and Shin Eun-mi, a Korean-American woman, were accused of making comments supportive or complimentary of North Korea, which is forbidden under the National Security Law. South Korea deported Ms. Shin on Saturday. Her deportation prompted the American State Department to cite fears that the National Security Law is being used to quash free expression.Ms. Hwang, once jailed for violating the law, also upset South Korean conservatives in 2005, when she gave birth to a daughter while visiting the North. Before her recent arrest, she told reporters that she was a victim of the hunt for jongbuk, a derogatory term for progressives accused by their conservative enemies of following North Korean ideology.Ever since Ms. Park took office two years ago, her critics have charged her government with using legal channels to clamp down on free speech, especially about matters concerning Ms. Park and her family.Tatsuya Kato, the former bureau chief here for the Japanese daily Sankei Shimbun, which has often criticized Ms. Park, is on trial in a South Korean court on defamation charges. Mr. Kato was charged after reporting a rumor last October indicating that Ms. Park may have had a tryst with one of her former advisers while her government was struggling with the sinking of a ferry in April.And late last year, several of Ms. Parks presidential aides filed a defamation lawsuit against the local daily Segye Ilbo after it reported internal documents leaked from her office. Some of the documents contained allegations that the aides  as well as Chung Yoon-hoi, the man Mr. Park was rumored to have met in secret in April  had conspired to promote people they favored in her government.Ms. Parks government called the allegations groundless rumors. During her New Years news conference on Monday, she accused those spreading such rumors of causing national confusion.In another current trial, two journalists who are vocal critics of Ms. Park are facing charges of defaming her family. Choo Chin-woo, a reporter with the leading newsweekly SisaIN, and Kim Ou-joon, a podcast star, face an appeals court ruling on Friday on charges of reporting an unconfirmed suspicion that Ms. Parks brother might have been involved in the murder of a relative.The two reporters were accused in late 2012 of defaming and spreading false information about the presidents brother, Park Ji-man, with an aim of blocking her election. They were acquitted in a lower court in October 2013, but the prosecutors appealed, seeking prison terms of several years for the two.South Korea portrays itself as one of Asias most vibrant democracies, a far cry from the dictatorship it was under military-backed authoritarian leaders like Ms. Parks father, Park Chung-hee, who ruled with an iron fist from 1961 until his assassination in 1979.Yet state censors still routinely purge contents deemed defamatory, pro-North Korean or pornographic from the countrys Internet. Fears of government censorship deepened after prosecutors started a new task force in September, vowing real-time monitoring and a constant crackdown on those who spread falsehoods or defamation in cyberspace. The move came two days after Ms. Park warned that slandering her had gone too far and would hurt the national prestige.In Reporters Without Borders annual press freedom index in 2014, South Korea dropped by seven notches to 57th out of 180 countries. The group cited the case of Mr. Choo and Mr. Kim.Its as if we are living in a barbarian age where the government rules with threats, trying to make journalists cower in fear, Mr. Choo said, accusing the government of using protracted lawsuits to exhaust and intimidate unfriendly reporters.

Tuesdays hangings, which were announced by the office of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, brought to 16 the total number of executions since the assault on the school.Human rights groups say the hangings smack of revenge and have failed to address the root causes of Islamist militancy. The Pakistani military and Mr. Sharifs government say that capital punishment acts as an effective deterrent.Some of those executed in the latest wave had been convicted of taking part in a plot to kill the former military ruler Pervez Musharraf. One of those hanged on Tuesday had been convicted of taking part in a 2003 assault on the United States Consulate in the southern port city of Karachi.Three others were hanged for their involvement in the 2001 killing of a Defense Ministry official.There is no room for terrorism or terrorists in our society, and government is determined not to be at ease till the elimination of the last terrorist from our country, Mr. Sharif said earlier on Tuesday while reviewing progress on the National Action Plan, a 20-point strategy devised to deal with terrorism after the Peshawar massacre.Public alarm and anger at the ruthlessness of the Taliban attack in Peshawar led lawmakers to hand new powers to the military. Last week, Parliament passed a constitutional amendment that empowers military courts to try suspected militants. On Tuesday, the government said the jurisdiction of those courts would be extended to Gilgit-Baltistan and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, districts that are administered under special rules, which may allow the courts to operate with a greater degree of secrecy.Officials say that since the Peshawar school attack, the police have started 164 investigations into hate speech in Punjab Province and Islamabad, and have made 157 arrests and closed 40 printing presses.The United States also ratcheted up pressure on the Pakistani Taliban. On Tuesday, the State Department announced that it had classified the groups nominal leader, Maulana Fazlullah, as a specially designated global terrorist, forbidding American transactions with him and freezing any assets of his that the United States can find. Some Pakistani officials had claimed that Afghan officials were using Mr. Fazlullah as a proxy against Pakistan.In his remarks in Islamabad, delivered alongside Sartaj Aziz, Mr. Sharifs adviser on national security and foreign affairs, Mr. Kerry urged Pakistani officials to also target the Haqqani network, which has carried out many attacks in Afghanistan, and other militant groups with longstanding ties to the Pakistani military.Clearly, there are sanctuaries, he said, but added that the United States was very pleased at recent Pakistani efforts to diminish those havens.Mr. Aziz said on Tuesday that Pakistans military operation in North Waziristan had been so successful that the infrastructure of the Haqqani network had been totally destroyed, and that its ability to use Pakistan as a base for attacks in Afghanistan had virtually disappeared.But the American assessment of the damage done to the Haqqani network was more qualified.Theyve been disrupted in the course of the North Waziristan operations, a senior State Department official told reporters Monday night. And so it has had at least some impact on their planning abilities. But we have to see whether thats a permanent disruption or whether they just regroup someplace else where they can get back up to full speed.Mr. Kerry said he had encouraged Pakistani officials to continue to strengthen their countrys previously fraught relationship with the Afghan government, now led by President Ashraf Ghani, and pledged American support for that effort.A planned trip by Mr. Kerry on Tuesday to the Peshawar school where the massacre took place was canceled because of bad weather, said another senior State Department official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, per department protocol.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "MICHAEL R.

{"body": "BEIJING   No stranger to engaging in power politics with its Asian neighbors, Chinas diplomatic corps has in recent months been trying on a new role: talking with the Afghan Taliban in an effort to play peacemaker.Late last year, two Afghan Taliban officials traveled with Pakistani officials to Beijing to discuss a potential peace process among Afghanistans warring parties, according to three current and former Afghan officials. And that may not have been the first such meeting. Though his account could not be independently confirmed, one Pakistani journalist said that Chinas special envoy to Afghanistan, Sun Yuxi, had traveled to Peshawar, Pakistan, to meet with Afghan Taliban representatives weeks earlier.Despite years of war and turmoil in Afghanistan, China had long seemed reluctant to become directly involved. So what has changed to move it to try to mediate with Islamist militants now? According to Chinese and foreign analysts, the answer lies in three factors: Chinas growing worries about a  on its own frontier; concern about more instability on its western border after the main American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan; and urgency to secure access to Afghan mineral and oil deposits where Chinese companies have already made large investments.Under the new situation, China is more willing to take on greater responsibility and more willing to proactively promote conciliation, said Zhao Huasheng, a professor and director of the Center for Russian and Central Asian Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.He added that China was in a good position to help shepherd a peace process, now only in the proposal stage, because China is not involved in Afghanistans domestic fights and, comparatively speaking, is pretty broadly accepted.Though they are wary about rising Chinese influence, American officials have long encouraged China to play a bigger role in Afghanistan, including using its deep influence with Pakistan to get Islamabad to grant the Americans more access to senior Taliban officials sheltering in that country.China has been unwilling to openly discuss any dealings it has had with the Taliban. On Jan. 6, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, did not confirm or deny that the recent Beijing meetings had taken place when asked about them at a regularly scheduled news conference. But he did say China would help with the peace process.As a friendly neighbor of Afghanistan, he said, China attaches great importance to developing relations with Afghanistan; hopes to see Afghanistan achieve lasting peace, stability and development at an early date; supports the Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process toward peace and reconciliation; and wishes to play a constructive role to that end.The establishing of ties between China and the Afghan Taliban would be significant, said Raffaello Pantucci, a scholar of Islamic militancy and China at the  in London.The key thing is that previously it seemed as if Pakistanis had controlled the entire relationship, Mr. Pantucci said of Chinese channels to the Afghan Taliban. Now it seems like the Chinese have a direct line, and they seem willing to admit to it. Whether this will result in something successful is unproven.I think the Afghans have been very keen for the Chinese to play a greater role in Afghanistan, he added. I think theyve generally been quite disappointed.The Afghan Embassy in Beijing did not reply to an interview request.The reported meeting between Mr. Sun and Afghan Taliban officials in Peshawar was first mentioned by Mian Abrar, an editor at Pakistan Today, in a column a week ago that cited Mr. Sun. In an email, Mr. Abrar said that Mr. Sun had told him about the Peshawar meetings when Mr. Abrar traveled to Beijing in November with a Pakistani Parliament delegation.Asked about the account of the Peshawar meeting from Mr. Abrar, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday in a written statement that it was inconsistent with the facts.The aim of Mr. Abrars column was to  of President Xi Jinping of China. He wrote: President Xi has taken another giant leap by extending support to the efforts to bring peace and normalization in Afghanistan. The assistance reflects another paradigm shift in the foreign policy of China, as the leadership has never involved itself in conflict resolution directly.The shift is heavily grounded in economics, for one.Mr. Xi has emphasized the importance of neighborhood diplomacy for China and is now promoting his countrys broad infrastructure and trade investments in what he calls a Silk Road Economic Belt across Central Asia. Chinas main investments in Afghanistan are the , which the state-run China Metallurgical Group Corporation has been trying to develop for years, and .Protecting economic interests is only natural, Mr. Zhao said.One person familiar with the November visit here by the Pakistani legislators said Chinese officials had told the Pakistanis that Beijing would not send combat troops to Afghanistan, but would send many investors if the Taliban joined the peace process.Analysts say Chinas biggest concern is how continued fighting in Afghanistan and militant havens in Pakistan might affect the security situation in the western region of Xinjiang, which shares a border with both countries.In Xinjiang, China is trying to suppress peaceful protests and attacks by , a mostly Muslim Turkic-speaking ethnic group. Hundreds of Uighurs and Han, the dominant ethnic group in China, were killed in violence last year. On Monday, police officers in Shule County  who had explosives on their bodies, according to a state news media report.There are signs that Uighur militants have been making use of training bases in the Pakistani tribal belt. In November, Afghan and Western officials said in interviews that the Afghan intelligence agency  that dozens of militant Uighurs caught inside Afghanistan in the past year had been trained in camps in Pakistan.Last March, Reuters did a , who said he was the leader of the , which seeks to free Xinjiang from Chinese rule. Abdullah Mansour said Uighurs were training in the mountainous tribal areas of Pakistan and planning many attacks on China.Many Uighurs and human rights advocates say Chinas repressive, anti-Islamic policies are driving some people to embrace a radical ideology that is espoused in teachings easily found on the Internet and other media.Last week, the Xinjiang Legislature approved banning the burqa from public spaces in Urumqi, the regional capital.Xinjiang officials have also detained or imprisoned three brothers of , a Uighur journalist who moved 20 years ago to the United States and reports on Xinjiang for Radio Free Asia.And in September, an Urumqi court sentenced , an economics professor in Beijing, to life in prison on charges of separatism, even though he had always promoted dialogue between Uighurs and Han.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "EDWARD WONG", "title": "Exploring a New Role: Peacemaker in Afghanistan - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/world/asia/exploring-a-new-role-peacemaker-in-afghanistan.html", "date": "JAN. 14, 2015"},
{"body": "HONG KONG  The embattled leader of s government warned on Wednesday that concessions to pro-democracy demonstrators could invite anarchy, as he laid out measures to defuse public anger over housing and inequality that resounded with the protesters who seized streets for 11 weeks last year.Leung Chun-ying, the chief executive of Hong Kong, offered the proposals in his  since the street demonstrations ended last month. Since Mr. Leung came to office in 2012, he has repeatedly vowed to redress the citys housing shortages and narrow the growing divide between rich and poor. But the protests echoed a view, particularly widespread among the young, that Mr. Leung is beholden to the citys pro-Beijing business elite.On Wednesday, Mr. Leung sought to counter the discontent over economic issues while ruling out any retreat from government proposals for changing the citys electoral rules. Those proposals, put forward by the Chinese national legislature on Aug. 31, were the trigger for the protests last year; They would give residents a direct vote for the chief executive, but only from among two or three candidates screened by a committee dominated by members loyal to Beijing. Mr. Leung said he would not bow to opponents demands to change the plan.The rule of law is the foundation of Hong Kong, Mr. Leung said in a televised address. The democratic development of Hong Kong must therefore be underpinned by the same. As we pursue democracy, we should act in accordance with the law, or Hong Kong will degenerate into anarchy.On the economic concerns, Mr. Leung called housing the most critical of all livelihood issues in Hong Kong and said, Sustained economic development will provide our young people with more and better employment opportunities and chances of upward mobility.But supporters of the recent demonstrations were skeptical that Mr. Leung could make good on his promises.The protesters  that the citys inequalities are yoked to its political dysfunctions because the government favors wealthy supporters. The 1,200-member election committee that appointed Mr. Leung included many executives allied with Beijing, who see their corporate strength as a pillar of the citys prosperity.Its kind of a clash between generations, said Au Wai-ling, a 22-year-old student of land surveying at the City University of Hong Kong. She said that home affordability was her biggest concern, although her major would give her good job prospects in the building sector. The government officials and ordinary citizens live in really different worlds, she said.Analysts said the demonstrations last year exposed a gulf of political distrust that is likely to persist, making governing the city increasingly difficult. Mr. Leungs report Wednesday to the citys Legislative Council was loudly interrupted by two lawmakers who accused him of earning illicit wealth, and of betraying the citys interests, before officials dragged them out of the chamber.More and more Hong Kong people believe that the political system is strongly skewed to commercial interests, leading to the problems they are now facing, said , director of the Center for Social Policy Studies at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.The government, lacking political legitimacy, is unable to move ahead to do something which is unpopular, Mr. Chung said. Hong Kong is going to be very difficult to govern.Buzz Yu, a 20-year-old student of electronic engineering, echoed that point of view. The Chinese government has lost this generations support, Ms. Yu said. She added of Mr. Leung, I can see his efforts to improve, but its not enough.The discontent here reflects a convergence of  and a shifting labor market, which has made it more difficult for younger residents to win a place in the middle class. The city has enjoyed robust growth, but secure, well-paid jobs for university graduates are not as plentiful as in past decades, , a professor of sociology and social policy at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, said in an interview.In a telephone survey of 1,545 residents in early January, 90 percent said housing problems should be Mr. Leungs priority,  at the University of Hong Kong. By contrast, 81 percent listed economic development and 72 percent listed political development as priorities.But the public reaction to Mr. Leungs promises was tepid. A poll by the University of Hong Kong unit of 640 residents found that 46 percent were dissatisfied with Mr. Leungs report, about 30 percent were satisfied, and the rest had mixed feelings, Radio Television Hong Kong, a public broadcaster, reported.Louis Ho, a 26-year-old employee of an e-commerce company, said he did not think the governments plans to sell more subsidized apartments would make much difference.Housing prices reach new records every year but my salary has barely nudged up, he said. Thats not an isolated issue; it relates to every part of a family life, he added. Im just waiting for the housing market to collapse. Im genuinely hoping that it does.The Hong Kong government, however, relies on land revenues. In some years, up to about a third of its income comes from land- and property-related sources, including land sales and stamp duties, said , an investment analyst in Hong Kong with long experience in the citys property sector.C. Y. Leung has inherited the bad consequences of past policies, said Mr. Churchouse, using the initials by which Mr. Leung is widely known. But this needs to be done faster.Hong Kongs rising property prices benefit owners and investors but have made it increasingly difficult for young workers to afford housing. In 2013, the median price of a home in Hong Kong was 14.9 times median household annual income, higher than in any other market covered in an . Average home prices in the city grew by 12 percent in the first 11 months of last year, according to government data.Mr. Leung started his career as a land surveyor and has long experience in housing policy. He has promised to ensure that , including 200,000 public rental units. Acquiring enough land has been difficult, and Mr. Leung detailed steps to speed up housing development approvals, warning that zoning and regulatory barriers, as well as housing density limits, would have to be eased, despite public opposition.The root of many social and economic problems in Hong Kong lies in the shortage of land for development, he said. We cannot have our cake and eat it.Supporters of the pro-democracy movement said Mr. Leung showed no appetite for changes that would hurt the citys wealthiest. At the height of the protests,  that giving ordinary residents an unfettered vote for their leaders would give poor residents too much political influence.On Wednesday, Mr. Leung made his case using less abrasive language. Some people have underestimated the importance of economic growth, he said. He added that the government must forestall any act that harms the investment and business environment.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "CHRIS BUCKLEY", "title": "Hong Kongs Leader Says Concessions to Protesters Could Lead to Anarchy - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/world/asia/hong-kongs-leader-says-concessions-to-protesters-could-lead-to-anarchy.html", "date": "JAN. 14, 2015"},
{"body": "GENEVA  Secretary of State  voiced support for s decision to convene a meeting in Moscow between representatives of the Syrian government and opposition, even though some leading moderate figures have said they do not plan to attend.We hope that the Russian efforts could be helpful, Mr. Kerry said on Wednesday at the start of a meeting in Geneva with Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy for the crisis in .Mr. Kerry also said that he hoped Mr. de Misturas attempts to negotiate local cease-fires in Syria, starting with the contested city of Aleppo, can have effect.Mr. Kerrys support for the Russian and United Nations initiatives comes at a time when the American-led push to negotiate a solution to the bloody Syria conflict has lost momentum. Mr. de Misturas step-by-step strategy to de-escalate the civil war has been attracting growing interest among some Obama administration officials.Mr. Kerry  that the United Statess goal was a transitional government in Syria that did not include President Bashar al-Assad. But Mr. Kerry refrained from making such an explicit demand in his remarks on Wednesday; instead he urged the Syrian leadership to reconsider what it is doing.It is time for President Assad, the Assad regime, to put their people first, and to think about the consequences of their actions, which are attracting more and more terrorists to Syria, basically because of their efforts to remove Assad, Mr. Kerry said.Russia, which has backed the Assad government politically and by sending arms, is planning to convene talks among the warring Syrian factions on Jan. 26 in Moscow.Mr. de Mistura is planning to send a representative to the Moscow meeting, an American official said. And there has been speculation that Mr. de Misturas efforts and the Russian initiative could be combined in some way to start a new peace process, or at least to diminish some of the fighting in a conflict that has already killed tens of thousands of people and displaced much of Syrias population.But several leading figures among the more moderate opponents of Mr. Assad have said that they do not believe Russia can be an impartial arbiter, and that they will not take part in the talks in Moscow. And some critics say that when it comes to the Russian initiative, the Americans appear to be grasping at straws.We dont have the conditions for the success of this meeting, Moaz al-Khatib, a cleric from Damascus and an exile figure who has some influence among the rebel fighters inside Syria, .Mr. de Mistura, who is planning to travel to Damascus next week, said Wednesday in Geneva that he appreciated Mr. Kerrys support. He said wanted to find a way to stop the fighting in Aleppo that could become a model for cease-fires elsewhere, and eventually lead to a political solution.I will continue, I can tell you, pushing for Aleppo because Aleppo has become an iconic example of where things could start sending the best signal, Mr. de Mistura said. In other words, that bombing, shelling, barrel bombing, mortar shelling would stop, and bring some humanitarian aid, which means giving some hope to the Syrian people.You know very well  we have been hearing it from Iran  the Syrian people are just saying, Enough,  he added.Following his meeting with Mr. de Mistura, Mr. Kerry met with the foreign minister of Iran, Mohammad Javad Zarif, at a luxury hotel here. Mr. Kerrys objective was to encourage progress in the on Irans , which are scheduled to resume in Geneva on Thursday.I think its important, Mr. Zarif told reporters before Mr. Kerry arrived for their meeting. I think it will show the readiness of the two parties to move forward, to speed up the process.The negotiations on limiting Irans nuclear program have been extended twice, and a deadline for showing progress is approaching. Iran and six world powers, including the United States, agreed in Vienna last year that a political accord outlining the main provisions of an agreement would be completed by March 1, and the full detailed agreement by July 1.Mr. Zarif gave no hint of whether Iran would soon release a Washington Post reporter, Jason Rezaian, who has been jailed for five months without access to an attorney.This is a judicial matter, so we will have to wait for the judiciary to move forward, Mr. Zarif said. He insisted that the Iranian government had provided Mr. Rezaian with humanitarian assistance by allowing his mother to visit him.Neither did Mr. Zarif say anything to suggest that than Iran would soon release Amir Hekmati, a former American Marine who, like Mr. Rezaian, holds dual American and Iranian citizenship.If they have dual citizenship, they are subjected to the laws of their country of origin, Mr. Zarif said when asked about Mr. Hekmati, who has been jailed for more than three years. And he is subjected to Iranian laws, and he has committed offenses that have been found by the Iranian judiciary. There again, on humanitarian grounds we tried to help, and we will continue to help.Mr. Hekmati recently  after receiving assurances from Iranian officials that his case will be reviewed, his family said.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "MICHAEL R.

I hope they solve the problem and save lives of innocent people, far from the political issues.Regular operations resumed at the crossing on Wednesday after Hamas left its outpost and the Palestinian Authority returned. But the situation remained precarious, and across Gaza, other symptoms of renewed factional tensions abounded. Analysts said both the survival of the Palestinian government and the Palestinians new international diplomatic campaign against Israel were at risk.Internal divisions have plagued the Palestinians since at least 2007, when Hamas won legislative elections and then  in a bloody battle.  continued to dominate the Palestinian Authority, which governed the West Bank, and the , which negotiated with Israel and conducted diplomacy worldwide.Hamas and the P.L.O. signed a  that led to a new  for the authority. But the pacts promise of new elections within six months has not come to fruition, and neither has the authority taken control of the Gaza border crossings or internal security in the territory.On Wednesday, Hamas convened a session of the moribund Palestinian Legislative Council, a step that directly contravened the reconciliation pact. The day before, Hamas-affiliated workers who have not received salaries for months staged an angry protest that placed the four Gaza-based ministers of the consensus government under siege.Hamas officials denounce , the leader of Fatah, the Palestinian Authority and the P.L.O., almost daily, and Mr. Abbas has yet to make good on his pledge to visit Gaza.Its dead, and it will be dead for a long time, Mkhaimer Abusaada, a political scientist at Al-Azhar University in Gaza City, said of reconciliation. We are back to mutual accusations.Mr. Abbas has  in his quest for Palestinian statehood, and has bolstered his standing on the Palestinian street  and by pushing for a  that would set a deadline for Israel to end its occupation of the West Bank. But many experts say it will be difficult for him to make real progress without control of Gaza.The fighting between Hamas and Israel during the summer caused widespread destruction in Gaza, and thousands of residents were left homeless, but the reconstruction effort led by the United Nations has been stalled by the Palestinian Authoritys inability to assert control over security and the border crossings. Five babies, several of them belonging to families living in damaged homes or flimsy tents, died from exposure during a fierce winter storm this month.Since Israel retaliated for Mr. Abbass move to join the international court by  government workers in Gaza and the West Bank have gone without their December paychecks.Al Quds, the leading Palestinian newspaper, said in an editorial on Wednesday that the vaunted reconciliation pact was seemingly turning into ink on paper, and that it was unbelievable and unacceptable that Gaza residents had become hostages in this dispute between Palestinian political parties.First and foremost, we must get our house in order, the editors wrote. The past years have proven that the division, bickering and accusations between the factions have pushed our cause back dozens of years.Perhaps the most complicated challenge is how to handle  in Gaza: the 70,000 who worked for the Palestinian Authority there before 2007, and an additional 40,000 who were hired during Hamass administration of the territory. The new government  to whittle down the roster, but the committee has not resolved anything. The governments leaders maintain that the Palestinian Authority cannot pay anyone affiliated with Hamas, which is deemed a terrorist organization by Israel and the United States, for fear of losing international donations, a mainstay.Hundreds of Hamas employees staged a sit-in on Tuesday at Mr. Abbass long-empty house in Gaza, surrounding the four Gaza-based government ministers who use it as an office. The protesting workers held empty pots and plates to highlight their plight after going unpaid for seven months other than a .These steps are only the beginning of a big escalation if the government remains silent toward our rights, said Mohammed Siam, the head of the employees union.As Hamas lawmakers gathered Wednesday at the Parliament building in Gaza City without their counterparts from other factions, Ahmed Bahar, the first deputy of the legislative council, warned that the delays in rebuilding Gaza and paying the workers would bring an explosion in the Gaza Strip. He condemned Mr. Abbas for participating in a solidarity march in Paris on Sunday, asking, Is it that tens of thousands of homes destroyed and Palestinian martyrs over the past years are not equal to victims who were killed in France?Salah Bardawil, another Hamas leader, said that Mr. Abbas, whose formal term, like those of the lawmakers, expired years ago, does not have constitutional legitimacy. Mahmoud al-Zahar, a Hamas hard-liner, declared that the consensus government has failed.Ziad Abu Amr, deputy prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, acknowledged that a recent visit by West Bank cabinet ministers to Gaza produced no progress, but he insisted that there is no alternative to the national consensus government.This requires that we make another serious attempt and try to demonstrate to the Palestinian public that the government is trying its best, Mr. Abu Amr said. And if Hamas chooses to jeopardize this effort, then Hamas will bear the responsibility. Our mandate as a government is clear, and we like to exercise it. There are problems. Some of these problems are not of our own making.As for Mr. Abbass broader diplomatic initiative, he said, The international community should not use this as a pretext for not doing what it should do in supporting our effort to reach a peaceful agreement and end the occupation., a Palestinian political columnist, said that with Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf states cracking down on Islamist movements and Iran and Syria having largely withdrawn financial support for Hamas, the faction is fighting for survival in a kind of castle mentality.The moment they give up control of the borders, they feel they will lose the only power they have left, Mr. Kuttab said.

{"body": "BRUSSELS  An adviser to Europes highest appeals court on Wednesday broadly endorsed the authority of the  to buy unlimited quantities of eurozone countries bonds to stabilize their economies during a crisis.The preliminary ruling represented a victory for , the president of the central bank, as he considers a major round of stimulus.The opinion involved a bond-buying program that Mr. Draghi outlined in 2012, although he has yet to deploy it. The bank is expected to soon unveil plans for an even broader program of , or so-called , and the decision could diminish the potential legal hurdles to the plan.Many economists have long advocated that the European Central Bank begin a quantitative easing program as a way to stimulate growth in the eurozone. The United States and Britain have used such methods to bolster their economies.On the expectation that Mr. Draghi will announce such a plan when the central bank meets next week in Frankfurt, investors on Wednesday bid up eurozone bonds. German 10-year government bonds rose, driving their yields, which move in the opposition direction of their prices, to a record low of 0.424 percent. The yields on bonds of five other eurozone members  Austria, Belgium, Finland, France and the Netherlands  also reached new lows, only slightly higher than Germanys.The euro, which would be relatively less attractive if the central bank pumped many more of them into the market through a bond-buying program, continued its fall of recent weeks, dropping on Wednesday to a $1.18, its lowest level since the end of 2005.The preliminary ruling was made by one of the advocates general at the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg, Pedro Cruz Villalon, who said that the bond-buying plan Mr. Draghi proposed in 2012 was compatible with European Union treaties. Mr. Cruz Villalon wrote that the program would be suitable for bringing about a reduction in the interest rates on government bonds and said the central bank would not be assuming a risk that will necessarily make it vulnerable to insolvency.But he also warned that the central bank should proceed with particular caution when buying government bonds, to avoid creating speculative behavior in the market.Judges at the Court of Justice endorse the advice of their advocates general in a majority of cases, although their decisions typically come months later.For now, though, the ruling seems to validate the broader powers that the European Central Bank has taken on, and aspires to, under Mr. Draghi, who  in late 2011. Besides seeking the ability to take potentially powerful steps to stimulate the economy, the central bank has taken on chief oversight of the eurozones biggest banks  a regulatory role that was previously parceled out among member states.Mr. Cruz Villalon did not suggest any explicit limits on the size of the central banks bond buying. Nor did he say that the European Central Bank should have priority over other bondholders if a debtor defaulted, a point that is likely to be viewed favorably by the central bank.If the central bank were a so-called senior bondholder, private investors might have been reluctant to buy the bonds. That, in turn, could undercut the aim of the bond-buying program, which is to create more demand and push down market interest rates.The opinion did warn the German constitutional court, which had referred the case to the Court of Justice, against meddling too much with European Central Bank policy. The courts must exercise a considerable degree of caution when reviewing the E.C.B.s activity, since they lack the expertise and experience which the E.C.B. has in this area, it said.The opinion did, however, admonish the European Central Bank to better explain the rationale behind its policies. It also said the central bank should not buy government bonds immediately after they are issued, but should wait to allow markets to determine a price.The bond-buying program that the court was assessing is one that Mr. Draghi announced at the height of the European  as part of his effort to do  to save the euro.The program, called , has never been deployed. But its mere announcement is widely credited with helping to rescue the currency by calming market forces that were pushing bond rates in Italy and Spain to dangerously high levels.The program drew consternation from a group of German lawyers and academics, who sued at their countrys constitutional court. They argued that the program opened the way to sharing the debt of member states in danger of defaulting. The German court then referred the case  for further guidance.Yves Mersch, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, called the opinion announced on Wednesday an important milestone.We have always been convinced that the bond-buying program at issue is legally sound and in line with our mandate, Mr. Mersch said in a statement.Jonathan Loynes, the chief European economist at Capital Economics in London, wrote in a research note that the ruling would seem to clear the path for the implementation of a full-blown quantitative easing at the banks policy meeting on Jan. 22.Some elements of the opinion could affect the way the program intended to help individual distressed economies would operate, but there seems little here to prevent a Q.E. program aimed at loosening monetary policy across the eurozone as a whole, Mr. Loynes wrote, referring to quantitative easing.Even though the adviser effectively said an expanded program could go ahead, Mr. Draghi still faces challenges from the central banks natural caution and from Germanys objections, Mr. Loynes wrote. Many Germans fear that they will be stuck with the bill if eurozone countries like Greece or Italy are unable to pay their debts.Proponents of quantitative easing are concerned that limits on the program could undercut its psychological impact on financial markets by raising doubts about how far the central bank would be able to go to restore inflation. at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in December, according to an official estimate, raising concerns that the eurozone could sink into deflation, an economic condition where people delay purchases because they expect prices to fall further. Deflation eventually undermines company profits and leads to higher unemployment.The central banks official target for inflation is below, but close to, 2 percent.The core inflation rate, which excludes energy and , ticked up to 0.8 percent in December from 0.7 percent the month before. While low inflation is good for consumers in the short term, it can make it difficult for companies to earn a profit and eventually force them to cut wages or dismiss workers. In addition, low inflation is bad for borrowers because it raises the effective interest rate they must pay.The program at issue in the lawsuit was intended to protect eurozone countries whose borrowing costs were being pushed higher by market panic. Quantitative easing has a different purpose  to generate inflation  and would probably involve purchases of bonds issued by all eurozone governments, rather than just those in crisis.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "JAMES KANTER", "title": "E.C.B.s Bond-Buying Program Is Legal, Adviser to Appeals Court Says - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/business/international/ecb-bond-buying-program-court-european-union.html", "date": "JAN. 14, 2015"},
{"body": "SAO PAULO, Brazil  Paulo Telhada rolls his eyes, denouncing s support for the leftist government of Venezuela. He frowns, grumbling about gun control measures.But when the subject turns to how many people he killed as a police officer on Sao Paulos streets, he gives a broad smile.More than 30, said Mr. Telhada, 53, a rising star in Brazilian right-wing political circles, having recently won a seat in Sao Paulos state legislature in a landslide.I feel no pity for thugs, he added, emphasizing that he did not enjoy working in a fancy office. But I know my future lies in politics now.Across Brazil, politicians like Mr. Telhada, with backgrounds in law enforcement or the armed forces, have been winning elections. In Congress, about 21 legislators now form what is called the bancada da bala, a bullet caucus seeking to bolster gun ownership and repeal laws keeping teenagers from being tried and sentenced as adults, among other conservative measures.Their rising clout points to a major shift in Latin Americas largest democracy. While Brazil is governed by President   a former leftist guerrilla who promotes the ,  and social welfare projects to reduce inequality  the insurgents of Brazilian politics now largely come from the right.The movement is national in scope, with figures like Moroni Torgan, a high-ranking leader of the Mormon Church in Brazil and a former police investigator. He received more votes in Octobers elections than any of the other candidates who won seats in the lower house of Congress for the northeast state of Ceara, campaigning on a platform of cracking down on drug trafficking.Others in the congressional bullet caucus, like Waldir Soares, a police investigator in the central state of Goias, are vowing to overhaul laws allowing criminals to avoid long prison sentences. Some are also fighting their own legal battles, including Eder Mauro, a police official under investigation for torture in Para, the vast state in Brazils Amazon.Political analysts attribute the rise of these conservative figures to a society  with violent crime. Drug gangs have  across the country, and Brazil now ranks as the worlds second-largest cocaine-consuming country after the United States. According to the United Nations, Brazil has , with 50,108 in 2012, though the per capita homicide rate remains below those in countries like Honduras and Venezuela.Some in the bullet caucus are making their presence felt at protests, like the ones in November along Sao Paulos leading thoroughfare, calling for the impeachment of Ms. Rousseff, who narrowly won re-election in October. Such demonstrations are still relatively small, but they point to a broader ideological shift with which Ms. Rousseff and her leftist Workers Party are grappling.Conservative caucuses, including powerful blocs of legislators promoting the  of evangelical Christian and agribusiness groups, now account for more than half the seats in Brazils lower house of Congress, the Chamber of Deputies.  of the ministers in Ms. Rousseffs 39-member cabinet now come from the Workers Party, reflecting the presidents need to forge coalitions with some conservatives from other parties.Some opponents of Ms. Rousseff, however, are growing bolder, delivering outbursts of criticism against the leftist establishment that have shocked many Brazilians.In a debate in December on the  committed during Brazils military dictatorship, which included the rape of female opponents of the government, one former military officer from Rio de Janeiro and ultraconservative fixture in Congress, Jair Bolsonaro,  from the podium of the lower house.I would not rape you, Mr. Bolsonaro, sometimes considered a pioneering member of the bullet caucus, told Maria do Rosario Nunes, a Workers Party legislator, after she called the dictatorship an absolute shame.You dont merit that, he continued, implying that she was not worthy of being raped by him.Mr. Bolsonaros son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, an official with the Federal Police, rode his fathers popularity in some circles by winning a seat in October elections as a congressman for Sao Paulo. As one of the bullet caucuss newest members, he told reporters that his father would have gunned down Ms. Rousseff in a presidential contest if he were her opponent.The belligerent language of the bullet caucus, whether in Brasilia or legislatures at the municipal and state levels, is worrying rights advocates who fear that the lawmakers will shield police officers from accountability for abuses, including . Brazils police kill an estimated 2,000 people a year, but it remains rare for officers to be convicted of wrongdoing in such cases.With Brazilian gun manufacturers  the campaigns of many bullet caucus members, concerns are also growing about efforts to repeal gun control measures that have  people from purchasing firearms since 2003. Brazil remains a major manufacturer of firearms, with many guns exported to neighboring countries and smuggled back into Brazil.Brazils disarmament legislation has saved many lives, said Marcos Fuchs, the adjunct director of Conectas, a leading Brazilian human rights group. Repealing it would be a disastrous reversal for the nation.But with fatigue persisting over huge corruption scandals in the administrations of Ms. Rousseff and her predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the growing popularity of political figures like Mr. Telhada, the retired Sao Paulo police officer, shows how attitudes in Brazil may be shifting.Mr. Telhada expressed dismay over immigrants from African countries, neighboring nations in Latin America and Haiti who are  into Sao Paulos old center. He disparagingly called the area where they are settling Africalandia, arguing that the Workers Party sees them as a new pillar of support.To crack down on undocumented immigrants and drug trafficking, he said that he supported transferring troops away from cities like Sao Paulo to patrol borders in the Amazon. Condemning gun control legislation, Mr. Telhada spoke glowingly of revolts like the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932, an uprising in Sao Paulo against the central government.If the Brazilian population were armed properly today, this government would be at serious risk, he said, while adding that he supported change at the ballot box and not through the barrel of a gun.The momentum of Mr. Telhada and other right-wing candidates has gained national attention. After serving on the City Council here since 2012, Mr. Telhada won a seat in Sao Paulos state legislature in October elections, obtaining more than 254,000 votes, the second-highest tally of any candidate in the race.Next, Mr. Telhada said he was setting his sights on Brasilia, where he potentially sees himself in a federal post overseeing security policies.Or maybe senator, he said.

{"body": "BEIJING  The police in Shanghai have arrested 10 Turkish citizens and two Chinese citizens and accused them of providing altered Turkish passports to terrorist suspects from the western region of Xinjiang, a state-run newspaper .The people trying to use the passports  nine ethnic  trying to leave China illegally through a Shanghai airport  are also under arrest, according to the newspaper, Global Times.All the suspects were detained in November and formally charged recently, the report said. It added that the nine Uighurs were planning to go to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria after leaving China. Audio and video materials with content related to terrorism were found on those trying to leave, the report said.Those involved in providing the forged passports have been charged with smuggling terrorists and altering legal documents, Global Times reported. On Wednesday afternoon, calls made to the Shanghai police seeking comment were not immediately answered.The Uighurs are a mostly Muslim, Turkic-speaking ethnic group in Xinjiang. Many Uighurs resent rule by the Communist Party, and some say they face discrimination by the Han, the dominant ethnic group in China. Violence in Xinjiang has been on the rise, and Chinese officials have deployed more security forces throughout cities with large Uighur populations and tried to suppress some Islamic practices, such as the wearing of burqas.Turkish leaders have made statements in the past supporting the Uighurs, including during  in Urumqi, the provincial capital of Xinjiang. Many Uighurs have sought refuge in Turkey, which is also a popular destination for Uighur students. The arrest of the 10 Turkish citizens could result in greater diplomatic tensions between China and Turkey. On Wednesday, a woman answering the telephone at the Turkish ambassadors office in Beijing said there was nobody available to comment on the issue.Survey results released last July by the Pew Research Centers Global Attitudes Project showed that in the 43 countries polled, Turks have among  of China, with 68 percent of those polled saying they held a negative view of the country.Many Uighurs have been trying to flee China to Turkey, usually by first traveling overland through Southeast Asian countries to Malaysia. Last year, , most of them women and children, were detained by Thai security forces in the jungles of southern Thailand. They told Thai officials that they were Turkish citizens and were later visited by diplomats from the Turkish Embassy in Bangkok. Chinese officials insisted to the Thai government that the migrants be sent back to China. The fate of those migrant Uighurs is unclear.Nine of the Turkish citizens arrested in Shanghai had come to China to hand over their passports to traffickers who were trying to smuggle out the Uighurs, the Global Times reported, adding that the Turks were paid $2,000 a passport. Each of the Uighurs had paid the traffickers 60,000 renminbi, or about $9,700, for a passport, according to the report. It said the Uighurs were trying to leave China on flights from Shanghai Pudong International Airport.The report identified the main two traffickers as Lamazan, a Turkish citizen, and Dawuti, a Chinese citizen living in Turkey. Dawuti is a Mandarin Chinese transliteration of a Uighur name. The report said Dawuti is a native of Kashgar, a Silk Road oasis city in the Uighur heartland near the border with Pakistan. The two men had a Turkish citizen, identified as Kaluke, alter the passports, the report said.Chinese leaders say terrorist groups are responsible for growing violence in Xinjiang, though officials have not given many details on the groups or much evidence of their activities. Many Uighurs and human rights advocates say  in the region  including its attempts to suppress Islamic practices  are laying the foundation for the violence and encouraging young Uighurs to embrace more militant teachings.

{"body": "BEIJING  Taxi drivers in a half-dozen cities across  have gone on strike in recent days to protest what they say are soaring expenses, shrinking incomes and the competition presented by a spate of new ride-hailing apps.Early in the week, hundreds of drivers in the northeastern rust-belt city of Changchun blocked roads, prompting the intervention of police officers who arrested scores of drivers, according to social media postings that were later deleted by censors.Cabbies in other cities, including Chengdu, in Sichuan Province, and Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, also took part in organized work stoppages.Last week, a two-day strike in Nanjing, a prosperous city in the Yangtze River delta, left thousands of people scrambling to find alternate transportation at the citys airport, train stations and bus terminals.In , one driver complained that he had to hand over more than half of his fare receipts to the fleet company from which he rented his vehicle. I get up before 6 a.m. every morning and sit for about 14 hours a day, only to get 2,000 yuan a month, or about $325, said the man, Liu Xingyou. Thats unbearable.His income is $70 less than the national average.Although taxi strikes in China are not new, the cascade of copycat protests around the country highlights the organizational power of social media, presenting a challenge to a government that has little tolerance for labor unrest.According to , a watchdog group based in Hong Kong, worker activism has surged over the past year, with 569 incidents counted in the final quarter of last year, or three times the number in the same period in 2013.The group said the increase in protests and strikes by truck drivers, construction workers and miners was probably due to a slowing economy, but also to the spread of inexpensive smartphones that have allowed organizers to spread the word about unpaid wages, broken contracts and other labor complaints.Cabdrivers in China have long complained about low wages and long days, but the recent strikes appear to also have been fueled by the spread of ride-hailing apps like Uber and a flurry of news media attention to what many drivers say is unfair competition.Last week,  that prohibit privately owned vehicles from using such apps to offer rides. In an announcement posted on its website last Thursday, the Ministry of Transport said that only licensed taxis could use ride-hailing apps, a ruling that would seem to favor homegrown Chinese apps that allow users to summon licensed taxis by paying an additional fee.While we encourage innovation, we prohibit private cars from using platforms to participate in the hired car business, the ministry wrote.Uber drivers in a number of Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Chongqing, have been fined in recent weeks, but the service remains widely available. Huang Min, a spokeswoman for Uber in China, said the company had not been contacted by the authorities.Geoffrey Crothall of China Labor Bulletin said the news medias focus on ride-hailing apps obscured the main complaint of the Chinese taxi drivers: that rapacious fleet companies charge onerous rental fees that leave drivers with little to show for their toil.Drivers are basically held hostage to the companies, and they are constantly getting squeezed, he said. But the discussion of these apps seems to have encouraged taxi drivers to press their case and try to draw attention to their longstanding grievances.The strikes, it seems, are having the desired effect, and a number of newspapers in recent days have published commentaries supporting the plight of the drivers. In an editorial published on Jan. 6, the official Peoples Daily described the current system as deformed and called for an end to the monopoly enjoyed by cab companies, many of which are owned by well-connected businessmen.The drivers are in an absolutely weak position, the editorial said. Its time to reform the taxi system.

{"body": "BEIRUT, Lebanon  A cover illustration of Prophet Muhammad in the latest edition of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo ignited controversy in the Middle East on Wednesday, prompting  and  to issue or threaten restrictions on publication of the images and stirring wide debate over religion and free speech.Some were outraged, while others called for free speech in countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt that punish people for alleged blasphemy. Many expressed indifference, saying they were weary of debating cartoons that paled in significance beside the carnage taking place in wars in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere in the region.In Egypt, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi issued a decree giving the prime minister authority to ban any foreign publications offensive to religion, the state-owned daily Al Ahram reported. Mr. Sisi has portrayed himself as a secular bulwark against Islamists.Egypts official religious institutions have had mixed reactions to the new cartoon.Dar al-Ifta, an organization of Sunni scholars, criticized the French publication on Tuesday for its decision to continue printing cartoons depicting the prophet, saying it would cause a new wave of hatred in French and western societies and declaring that the magazine does not serve coexistence and the dialogue of civilizations that Muslims seek.But Al-Azhar University, the foremost institution of Sunni scholarship, on Wednesday called on people to ignore the cartoons. Ignore this unpleasant trifle, the statement advised, because the Prophet of mercy and humanity (peace be upon him) is on too great and high a level to be affected by drawings that lack ethics.The Egyptian Family House, an organization of the countrys main Muslim and Coptic Christian authorities, issued a statement decrying the cartoons because they increase the gap between people and religions and calling on media outlets not to negatively target the prophets and the heavenly religions, and not to provoke the feelings of Muslims.Egyptian courts have recently sentenced a 21-year-old student to three years in jail for atheism and what were deemed blasphemous statements on his Facebook page, and a Christian man was sentenced last year to six years for insulting Islam.In Turkey, like Egypt a large and influential Muslim country, a local court in the southern city of Diyarbakir ordered the blocking of sections of four websites that showed the new cartoon, the semiofficial Anadolu news agency reported.The image depicts Muhammad weeping and holding a sign saying I am Charlie in French, the slogan adopted by many of those protesting the attack by Islamist extremists on the Charlie Hebdo headquarters, which killed 12 people.Insulting the prophet can never be regarded within the context of media freedom, Ercan Ezgin, a Turkish lawyer, wrote in the complaint that prompted the ruling in Diyarbakir, according to the CNN Turk channel. This cartoon bears the danger of deeply provoking billions of Muslims. It should never be acceptable to depict our prophet in such a cartoon, poking fun at him, showing him as if hes shedding tears.But one Turkish website, T24, translated the entire new issue of Charlie Hebdo into Turkish and those pages were still accessible Wednesday evening.In the early morning hours on Wednesday, the Turkish police halted trucks distributing Cumhuriyet, a left-wing newspaper that carried four pages from Charlie Hebdos new issue. Distribution resumed only after investigators checked the contents of the paper and concluded that none of the cartoons represented the prophet, Turkish news media reported.The newspaper received numerous threats over the phone and the Internet. Near the Cumhuriyet headquarters in central Istanbul, the police detained a protester who carried an Islamic flag, shouting, You will not attack my religion, my prophet, according to CNN Turk.Three more protesters were detained close to Cumhuriyet newspaper premises late Wednesday after they held signs carrying death threats against any one who insulted Islam and its prophet.If you have limitless freedom of speech, Muslim community has limitless right to protest, one handwritten sign read, a photograph posted on Twitter showed.Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite group whose leader, Hassan Nasrallah, last week extremists who kill those they consider infidels in the name of Islam  without explicitly denouncing the Paris killings  released a statement Wednesday condemning the new cartoon.Such an action is absolutely rejected, it said. He called cartoon a big provocation to the feelings of more than one and a half billion Muslims in the world, all of them believers in heavens messages and keen for dialogue and common values. Such actions directly contribute to supporting terrorism, extremism and extremists.The Islamic State militant group  to which one of the Paris attackers swore allegiance  declared on its Internet radio channel: In a very idiotic move, Charlie Hebdo published in new edition an offensive drawing of the greatest prophet, peace be upon him. The atheist journal is seeking to exploit the recent events to gain more money with todays edition.Another Twitter account that often praises the group called on users to bombard a French Foreign Ministry account with condemnation of the cartoons, and sent its own message that read: Stop insulting our sanctities. If you do not stop insulting the Messenger of God, the Islamic State will start slaughtering you in your streets.Syrias president, Bashar al-Assad, said in comments published Wednesday in a Czech newspaper that the attacks in Paris were a result of Western support for terrorism, referring to Western backing of insurgents opposed to his rule.We are against the killing of innocent people anywhere in the world, Mr. Assad said, drawing anger and ridicule from Syrians opposed to his rule, who noted that his government has killed countless Syrians in indiscriminate bombardments during four years of civil war that have left more than 200,000 dead.But on Syrian Facebook groups and other social media sites used by both supporters and opponents of Mr. Assad, there was little discussion Wednesday of the new cartoon.In an  in Politico, Hisham Melhem, the Washington bureau chief of Al Arabiya, the Saudi-owned pan-Arabic news channel, sought to explain why there was little groundswell of interest.Western politicians and scholars anticipating or asking for meaningful political and religious reforms by the nonexistent organized moderates in todays Arab world will be better advised to be patient and bid their time, he wrote. Can those living in Baghdad, Aleppo, Sana, and Tripoli  just to name few Arab cities  be blamed if they were not shocked by the killing of the Charlie Hebdo twelve in Paris? Not is only Islams religious text being distorted, a whole Arab generation has been totally desensitized by unspeakable violence.He went on to note that more than 76,000 Syrians died in 2014, the deadliest year since the uprising began, and that an average of 1,000 Iraqis died per month. No one has a clear idea about the number of the maimed and the missing, he wrote, and of those uprooted, and those being claimed by the waves of the Mediterranean while sailing aimlessly seeking a foreign shelter.In Geneva, while waiting for a meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry in a luxury hotel, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was asked by reporters why his government had criticized the cover of the new issue.We believe that sanctities need to be respected, and unless we learn to respect one another, it will be very difficult in a world of different views and different cultures and civilizations, Mr. Zarif said. And I think we would have a much safer, much more prudent world if we were to engage in serious dialogue, serious debate about our differences, and then we will find out that what binds us together is far greater that what divides us.We are now faced with very serious problems of extremism, not only in the Middle East but unfortunately in Europe, Mr. Zarif added. Youve seen demonstrations here in Europe that are extremely dangerous.In Britain, more than 50 prominent appealing for calm.Most Muslims will inevitably be hurt, offended and upset by the latest cartoon, the letter said. But our reaction must be a reflection of the teachings of the gentle and merciful character of Muhammad.The best way to respond, it said, was to display enduring patience, tolerance, gentleness and mercy.The six-page document said there had been an increase in attacks against places of worship; abuse on the grounds of religion; violence or threats against security forces; racist, anti-Semitic or discriminatory speech; and the glorification of terrorism.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "ANNE BARNARD", "title": "New Charlie Hebdo Muhammad Cartoon Stirs Muslim Anger in Mideast - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/world/middleeast/new-charlie-hebdo-muhammad-cartoon-stirs-muslim-anger-in-mideast.html", "date": "JAN. 14, 2015"},
{"body": "PARIS  The French authorities moved on Wednesday to reinforce a clampdown on hate speech and anti-Semitism, as the weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo returned defiantly to the newsstands with a depiction of the Prophet Muhammad on its cover, just one week after Islamist gunmen slaughtered 12 people in an attack on its offices.In some places, vendors reported that their allotment of the publication had sold out before daybreak, and demand was so intense that copies of the newspaper were being offered on eBay for hundreds of dollars. Some vendors drew up waiting lists of customers in anticipation of new supplies for a print run that could reach five million, compared with 60,000 before the attacks.The frenzy drew a vivid backdrop to the sharpening debate between proponents of press freedom and defenders of religious proprieties. The three-day onslaught last week has left the French authorities struggling to find ways to confront an unfamiliar form of terrorism, by lone militants or groups that are difficult to detect.Thousands of troops and police officers have been deployed on the streets, but the authorities are also trying to move against what the prime minister, Manuel Valls, called social media sites that are more than ever used for indoctrination of militants who use the Internet to communicate and acquire techniques permitting them to act.The interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said on Wednesday that he would soon visit the United States, where he will try to persuade large American Internet companies to support counterterrorism action by governments.At a meeting of interior ministers in Paris on Sunday, Mr. Cazeneuve told a French radio station that senior law enforcement officials, including Americans, were in favor of establishing close contact with Twitter, Google and other operators to say to them: Look out, there is a problem. You must mobilize with us.His remarks reflected an increasingly tense confrontation between governments seeking easier access to data as part of counterterrorism campaigns, and technology giants prepared to use increasing levels of encryption to avoid the perception that they act as agents of official intelligence-gathering.In an official circular to prosecutors on Wednesday, meanwhile, the French Justice Ministry laid out plans for a crackdown on what it described as an increase in attacks against places of worship; abuse on the grounds of religion; violence or threats against security forces; racist, anti-Semitic or discriminatory speech; and the glorification of terrorism.Prosecutors should guarantee a systematic criminal response to such offenses, especially those committed in prison, it said.As part of the same broad response to the attacks, 54 people are under investigation related to charges of glorifying terrorism and terrorism threats, according to Pierre Rance, a spokesman for the Justice Ministry. Thirty-seven people are suspected of glorifying terrorism, with the rest described as people who have threatened to carry out terrorist acts.The office of the Paris prosecutor, meanwhile, said separately on Wednesday that , Dieudonne Mbala Mbala, had been detained as an apologist for terrorism because of a comment on Facebook about one of the attackers in Paris.Prosecutors opened an investigation into the comedian on Monday after he referred in a Facebook post to Amedy Coulibaly, accused of killing four hostages at a kosher supermarket in Paris on Friday and of fatally shooting a police officer the day before.Mr. Coulibaly was shot to death by the police on Friday at almost the same time security forces killed Said and Cherif Kouachi, the brothers who are suspected in the Charlie Hebdo attacks, at a printing warehouse northeast of Paris.Under French law, praising terrorism publicly is a crime punishable by five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros, or $89,000. The punishment can rise to seven years in prison and 100,000 if the conviction is for a charge involving the Internet.In a note on his Facebook page, directed at Mr. Cazeneuve and written after the unity rally on Sunday in Paris, Mr. Mbala Mbala said that the same government officials who had marched to promote freedom and liberty were now trying to silence him.Since the beginning of last year, I have been treated as public enemy No. 1, , when all I try to do is make people laugh, and laugh about death, because death laughs at us all, as Charlie knows now, unfortunately.He continued: Whenever I express myself, some people will not even try to understand me, they will not listen. They try to find some kind of pretext to suppress me. I am looked upon as if I were Amedy Coulibaly, when I am no different from CharlieThe publication of the new issue of the satirical weekly has spurred heated debate about the limits of free speech, with some arguing that laws that ban hate speech fail to prevent insults and provocations directed at Muslims. Some legal experts say that the grounds for complaints against hate speech, including the accusation that the humanity of a group or community has been defamed, are open to subjective interpretations.The discussion has also provoked complaints about a perceived double standard in European countries with respect to their treatment of Muslims.In Geneva, while waiting for a meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry in a luxury hotel, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was asked by reporters why his government had criticized the cover of the new issue.We believe that sanctities need to be respected, and unless we learn to respect one another, it will be very difficult in a world of different views and different cultures and civilizations, Mr. Zarif said.

Youve seen demonstrations here in Europe that are extremely dangerous.Mr. Kerry is to travel to Paris on Friday to meet with President Francois Hollande  apparently a belated diplomatic effort to offset the absence of a high-ranking American figure during a mass rally on Sunday, when about 40 world leaders joined more than one million people in central Paris in a display of solidarity and defiance after the shootings.The attack in Paris on Jan. 7 was portrayed as a bloody protest by the Kouachis against Charlie Hebdos frequent depictions of the Prophet Muhammad. In an Internet post on Wednesday, the extremist group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen,  to avenge what it called the denigration of Muhammad by the French publication.Many Muslims say that depictions of the prophet, even in reverence, are sacrilegious.The latest cover of the newspaper shows a tearful Muhammad under a headline saying All Is Forgiven. The prophet is shown holding a placard with the slogan Je Suis Charlie, or I Am Charlie, which has become the rallying cry of advocates of press freedom since the killings.Commuters said lines of up to 80 people snaked around newsstands as people awaited a chance to buy a copy of the new issue. In some places, kiosks had sold out by early morning, and distributors said they would try to get more copies by Thursday.In the upscale 16th Arrondissement, a notice said that the newspaper had sold out by 6:45 a.m. In the Seventh Arrondissement, a shopper at a supermarket said she had scoured the neighborhood but had been unable to find a copy.It was incredible. I had a queue of 60-70 people waiting for me when I opened, a vendor in Paris said. Ive never seen anything like it. All 450 of my copies were sold out in 15 minutes.The choice of an image of Muhammad for the first cover after the shootings raised fears in some parts of the Muslim world that it would exacerbate tensions.In Turkey, which is predominantly Muslim, a secular newspaper, Cumhuriyet, said on Wednesday that the police had checked the newspapers content after it decided to print some of the caricatures from the newest edition of Charlie Hebdo.The police allowed the newspaper to be distributed after finding that it had not reprinted the contentious cover showing Muhammad.

{"body": "NAIROBI, Kenya   A recently captured Ugandan rebel commander who is accused of helping plan massacres and kidnap countless children will be handed over to the , Ugandan and Western officials said on Tuesday.Dominic Ongwen, a commander in the Lords Resistance Army and one of the most notorious fugitives in Africa, was detained by American Special Forces last week in , the officials said., which was terrorized by the Lords Resistance Army for years, initially indicated that it wanted to try Mr. Ongwen itself. The Ugandans said they had the capacity to hold a fair trial, and just last month Ugandas president, Yoweri Museveni,  from the International Criminal Court, describing it as a vessel for oppressing Africa.Im done with that court, Reuters quoted Mr. Museveni as saying in December. I wont work with them again.By Tuesday, Uganda seemed to have changed its mind.Finally, it has been decided, Ugandas military spokesman, , said on Twitter. Ongwen will be tried at the ICC in The Hague.Mr. Ongwen, believed to be around 35, was a top commander in the Lords Resistance Army, a brutal rebel group that originated in Uganda but in recent years slunk north into the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic, leaving a trail of burned villages and crushed skulls. The group is believed to have slaughtered thousands of civilians and kidnapped tens of thousands of children, forcing them to become soldiers and sex slaves.Early this month, Mr. Ongwen abruptly  to the Seleka armed group in northern Central African Republic, officials said. The Seleka fighters,  overthrew the government in their own country in 2013, now want  the American government had offered for Mr. Ongwens capture. Some analysts believe Mr. Ongwen turned himself in because he feared that , the mercurial leader of the Lords Resistance Army, wanted to kill him.Mr. Kony is arguably the most wanted man on the African continent, and is believed to be flamboyantly violent. Defectors have said that he speaks in tongues and often impersonates spirits, including one called Who Are You and another known as King Bruce. He has eluded capture for more than 20 years. in 2012, and last week they were called to pick up a defector in northern Central African Republic who was calling himself Ali.Ali ended up being Mr. Ongwen, Ugandan officials said, and he was flown by helicopter to a small American military base in the Central African Republic jungle.Uganda is one of the Pentagons favorite allies in Africa, and American officials have been in close discussions with the Ugandans about where Mr. Ongwen should be tried.Over the next few days, Western diplomats said, Mr. Ongwen will be transferred to the custody of the Central African Republic government or the African Union, then sent by plane to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, where he has been charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes.Western officials said Mr. Ongwen had been extensively interrogated since his surrender, but it was not clear if he had any recent information about Mr. Kony. One of the tactics of the Lords Resistance Army is to break into small bands of fighters, who then sneak into villages to slaughter civilians and kidnap children.Mr. Ongwen was abducted himself when he was 10, while walking to school. Ugandan officials said that he had been trained to club people to death and that he had gone on to plan brutal massacres.

{"body": "As  sailed toward its opening date on the Bowery last year, the restaurants owner, Keith McNally, summoned his two chefs so he could sample and critique the dishes they had dreamed up for the French-inspired menu.The chefs, Shane McBride and Daniel Parilla, knew their coup de grace might also be something of a gamble: a thick Jurassic plank of flesh and fat of the sort thats usually associated with weddings and bar mitzvahs. In other words, they hoped to reacquaint their boss  the longtime sultan of downtown scene-building  with the decidedly regal, uptown pleasures of prime rib.We put it in front of Keith, and his eyes opened up like he was a little kid, Mr. McBride said. Now, prime rib is the restaurants .We wanted to do a cut of meat that nobody was doing, Mr. McBride added.Nobody? Prime ribs image as a Sunday-dinner dinosaur that has been exiled to the hinterlands of the Las Vegas banquet hall has been greatly exaggerated.In the Boston area these days, you can settle in for a tasting menu from the chef Jason Bond of  (with locations in Cambridge and Concord) and learn that one of the courses involves that hunk of beef dangling and dripping fat next to the fireplace. On Sundays and Mondays at Lafayette in NoHo,  and his crew clear space on the rotisserie to allow entire rib roasts to be licked by the heat, then serve up the slabs with wild mushrooms and potato cakes. Its not something we have a hard time selling, Mr. Carmellini said.In just the last few weeks, prime rib has materialized on the menus at two of-the-moment spots where you wouldnt expect it: the chef s reconfigured Mission Chinese Food, near the southern rim of Chinatown, and the chef s Juniper Commons, on the main drag of Broad Street in Philadelphia. Mr. Bowien has made many pilgrimages to  in San Francisco, a carnivores shrine, established at the beginning of Californias postwar boom in 1949, where the meat is squired around in stainless-steel carts and carved tableside; those visits and the extravagance of Chinese banquets inspired him to include prime rib on the menu.A special occasion is what it represents, Mr. Bowien said.In that spirit, some restaurants are offering prime rib (and an array of sides and condiments, like Yorkshire pudding and horseradish cream) as a command performance. Call a day or two ahead, and the chefs  and Christina Lecki will mount a rib-focused bacchanal at  in NoMad. Josh Capon will do the same at  in SoHo, as will Frank Falcinelli and Frank Castronovo at  in Brooklyn. At Porter House New York in the Time Warner Center,  and his team will go the distance, rolling a shiny leviathan of a silver cart alongside your booth.Theres something about tableside service, Mr. Lomonaco said. It tells you that were serious about certain things. Serious, in his case, means aging the beef for 120 days so that, as the chef puts it, theres a beautiful blue-cheese funk on it.Prime rib is not a steak; its a roast, and the difference is what lends it its towering grandeur. That, and the fact that there is gleaming equipment (even vehicles!) designed for the sole purpose of serving it up.A piece of prime rib has neighborhoods: the ruby-red eye at the center, the tantalizing bridge of fat, the tender and salty crust on the outside rim, the gnaw-ready patches along the bone. You can have three different experiences in one cut, Mr. Sbraga said.Returning to those precincts of meat has a way of transporting diners back to a childlike state of awe. Whether we remember encountering it in London, in Los Angeles or at a barbecue palace in , prime rib is a cut of beef that conveys a sense of the ceremonial. If we happen to recall digging a fork and knife into it for the first time, we may also call up a memory of wearing a clip-on tie or Mary Janes.But because of prime ribs link to the all-you-can-eat casino smorgasbord, and because its an undertaking to cook correctly and quite expensive to produce if youre not sure that youre going to sell a lot of it, it fell out of favor with many chefs, even if many diners never lost their appetite for it.Its a science in itself to be able to cook a prime rib at the right temperature for the right amount of time, said , the chief executive at Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors and the author of a recent book, simply called . Now that he is seeing this resurgence in demand for it, theres a concomitant demand for his crash-course tutorial on the difference between a hulking seven-ribbed roast and, say, a cowboy steak. (The latter is a bone-in rib-eye that has been sliced off the standing rack and cooked as an individual steak, on a grill or in a pan, instead of being slowly roasted alongside its fellow ribs.)Ive had to help a lot of chefs through this conversation, Mr. LaFrieda said.Many chefs, of course, have a personal approach to preparing it. Mr. Capon, who reveres prime rib as one of my favorite things in the entire world, gives the object of his adoration a surprising twist when he prepares it for the $68-a-person feasts at B & B Winepub: He steams it for eight hours before giving it a rapid sear on a plancha.At Lafayette, Mr. Carmellini packs salt, cracked peppercorns and dried herbs on the surface of the roast before letting its crust thicken during a roughly 90-minute ride on the rotisserie. Theres no fermented paste, no anchovies  its very traditional, he said. Its nothing groundbreaking, technique-wise. Its just good beef.Indeed, for Mr. Bond, of Bondir in Massachusetts, the most important thing is the breed of cattle that the meat comes from; he taps a farm in Maine for cuts of Randall Lineback, a heritage breed with roots in New England.Chefs are going to such lengths even when their goal is to present prime rib in less conventional forms and not under a heat lamp, said Nate Anda, at a meat-focused spot called  in Washington, D.C. He buys the beef from two small family-owned farms: Leaping Waters in Virginia, and Wagon Wheel in Maryland. He ages it for 90 days, gives it a powdering with a mix that involves fennel pollen and red-pepper flakes, lets it cook slowly in a sous vide bath for eight hours, rests it, sears it and then slices off thin pink slivers to be served with flatbread as a riff on an Italian beef sandwich.In Los Angeles, youll find prime rib all over the chef s menus, whether the form it takes is the Tinys prime-rib rice plate at Chego or the French-dip sandwich at Commissary, his new spot at the Line hotel. Mr. Choi sees those dishes as a quiet tribute to the royal role that prime rib plays in Southern California, at landmarks like  and . (It also has a special resonance for local Korean immigrants who saw a plate-covering bounty of beef as a sign that they had made it.)Its a part of our life out here, Mr. Choi said. As much as going for steak at Peter Lugers in New York is the epitome of a place.Does all of this signify a comeback? Or does prime rib just represent a culinary-world analogue to Michael Keatons character in Birdman, waiting around for us to rediscover the greatness in our midst?I dont know why its back, Mr. Carmellini said. I dont have an answer.

This 70-minute fugue-like production, which opened on Tuesday night at  takes that most elemental of dramatic setups  boy meets girl  and then spins it into a seeming infinitude of might-have-been alternatives.This is achieved through the application of the principles of string theory, relativity and quantum mechanics, although dont ask me to explain precisely how. In college, I barely squeaked through Physics for Poets. But I had no difficulty following the convolutions of the relationship between Roland (Mr. Gyllenhaal), a beekeeper, and Marianne (Ms. Wilson), a Cambridge University academic specializing in theoretical early universe cosmology.Did I just hear you gulp? Or perhaps sigh at the prospect of another sentimental portrait of a British brainiac, what with those Oscar-bait movies starring Eddie Redmayne and Benedict Cumberbatch as geniuses under siege?You are probably more apt to discover your own self in the characters of Constellations, which was first staged in London in 2012 and arrives here in a  production. I would even venture that its impossible not to identify with Roland and Marianne if youve ever been in love. No, make that if youve ever relived your life in your mind, considering the factors that made things happen as they did.Though I loved Constellations  three years ago, there were no guarantees that it would cross the Atlantic unscarred. It was originally staged in the tiny upstairs space of the Royal Court Theater, and acted by Sally Hawkins and Rafe Spall with such intimate delicacy that you felt like an unseen eavesdropper in a bedroom.Moving to Broadway inevitably means growing bigger and, if calculating producers have their way, landing proportionately bigger stars. The requisite glamour quotient has been filled by Ms. Wilson, a veteran of the London stage best known to American audiences for the sensual Showtime series  (for which she just won a ), and Mr. Gyllenhaal, a movie marquee name of long standing.But as staged by its original director, Michael Longhurst, Constellations has been scaled up without bloat, and its every bit as affecting as I remember. Tom Scutts set is, as it was, a tabula rasa  a black box punctuated by suspended clusters of white balloons, lighted with finesse by Lee Curran  on which small, individual destinies may be written, and rewritten, ad infinitum.The authors of these destinies may have unusual occupations. But it is essential that they register as schmoes like us. Mr. Gyllenhaal and Ms. Wilson, I am happy to report, have seldom appeared less obviously compelling on the surface. Their starlight has been banked and internalized. This means that while we see them as they see each other, we are also allowed to see them as they see themselves  which is as gauche lummoxes.They are crippled by self-consciousness when they meet and remain so, to fluctuating degrees, even as they grow closer. Constellations is about, among other things, how inevitably fraught and imperfect communication is, even with people closest to you. Conversations here, both casual and life-changing (and these arent mutually exclusive), are always a matter of shouting and signaling across an unbreachable gulf.Because they are the creations of a wise and compassionate young playwright, Roland and Marianne have been allowed to revise and reinflect such conversations. By conventional standards, there are only four or five proper scenes in Constellations.But each of those vignettes  starting with Roland and Mariannes first encounter, at a barbecue given by mutual friends  is presented multiple times. Its boy meets girl, girl meets boy, boy (or girl) gets and loses and gets girl (or boy) over and over again.At one point, Marianne explains to Roland that in the quantum multiverse, one of her areas of study, every decision youve ever and never made exists in an unimaginably vast ensemble of parallel universes. Thats the template for Constellations, and you dont have to be Stephen Hawking to have applied this idea to your own experience.Who among us hasnt tried to reconstruct a moment from our lives that had further-reaching consequences than we ever expected? (This same idea is given more bald and schematic life by the current musical If/Then.) Constellations assesses the variables of such moments, factoring in the unreliability of memory, and suggests how even a change in tone of voice can alter the course of events.This makes the play both a treat and a potential trap for its performers. They have a glorious opportunity to keep trying out the same lines with different readings, which is standard practice on a movie set, but seldom in live theater.But they must also bring the same weight and conviction to every interpretation, or else the play can feel like a virtuoso acting exercise. Its no surprise that , a two-time Olivier Award winner, is comfortable with her roles demands. But , whose theater experience is more limited, is every bit as persuasive.They are both fluent in the awkward body language of nerds in love, and in the crossed signals of emotional ambivalence. But they use contrasting and complementary physical vocabularies to balance, gracefully and clumsily, shifts in power and longing, aggression and retreat.Mr. Gyllenhaals Roland, a magnificent work of understatement, is the more naturally inhibited. His default stance is a hunch, with his hands buried in his pockets, and theres a valiance in his eternal attempts to break through that posture.Ms. Wilson is more expansive of gesture; you suspect that her Marianne sees her intellectuality as a social handicap, and she overcompensates by being louder and funnier than she needs to be. This makes her all the more moving whenever words start to fail her.And though Constellations is a supremely articulate play, it knows that words inevitably fail, that they are never enough to bind two people together forever. Time, it turns out, is a more effective breaker of hearts than human beings, with all their conflicted intentions, can ever be. This story of parallel universes is universal in every sense of the word.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "BEN BRANTLEY", "title": "Constellations, With Jake Gyllenhaal and Ruth Wilson, Opens on Broadway - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/theater/constellations-with-jake-gyllenhaal-and-ruth-wilson-opens-on-broadway.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "Bullets were flying in the cities. Crack wars trapped people in their homes. The year was 1994, and President Bill Clinton captured the grim national mood, declaring gangs and drugs have taken over our streets as he signed the most far-reaching crime bill in history.The new law expanded the death penalty, and offered the states billions of dollars to hire more police officers and to build more prisons. But what was not clear at the time was that violent crime had already peaked in the early 90s, starting a decline that has cut the nations rates of murder, robbery and assault by half.Perhaps nowhere has the drop been more stunning than in New York City, which reported only 328 homicides for 2014, compared with 2,245 in 1990. The homicide rate in some cities has fluctuated more  Washington ticked up to 104 in 2014, after a modern low of 88 in 2012. But that still is a drastic fall from a peak of 474 in 1990.Now, Democrats and Republicans alike are rethinking the vast, costly infrastructure of crime control and incarceration that was born of the earlier crime wave.The judicial system has been a critical element in keeping violent criminals off the street, said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, who is co-sponsor of a bill to reduce some federal drug sentences. But now were stepping back, and I think its about time, to ask whether the dramatic increase in incarceration was warranted.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the new chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has opposed broad reductions in sentences. But he still agreed, in an interview, that there are a lot of ideas  prison reform, policing, sentencing  being discussed now that wouldnt be if we hadnt had this drop in the crime statistics.Yet even as law enforcement and the political establishment look toward a new era, the reasons for the broad drop in crime remain elusive. It has confounded both those from the right who had predicted that waves of young predators would terrorize communities and those on the left who watched crime fall even through ups and downs in poverty and unemployment.There are some areas of consensus. The closing of open-air drug markets drove down shootings in many urban areas. Credit is also given to a revolution in urban policing, in which officers concentrate on crime hot spots, as small as a block or a bar, that are responsible for outsize mayhem.The major increases in drug and gun sentences in the 1980s and 90s played some role but only a modest one, most experts say, with soaring incarceration rates bringing diminishing returns while disproportionately hitting minorities.Various experts have also linked the fall in violence to the aging of the population, low inflation rates and even the decline in early-childhood lead exposure.But in the end, none of these factors fully explain a drop that occurred, in tandem, in much of the world.Canada, with practically none of the policy changes we point to here, had a comparable decline in crime over the same period, said Franklin E. Zimring, a law professor and an expert in criminal justice at the University of California, Berkeley. He described the quest for an explanation as criminological astrology.The fall in serious crime was accompanied by declines in other social ills such as teenage pregnancy, child abuse and juvenile delinquency, emphasizing the role of cultural shifts beyond the ken of the justice system.Young people are growing up in a safer environment and behaving more responsibly, said Jeremy Travis, president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and co-editor of a  by the National Academy of Sciences on the consequences of mass incarceration.Along with uncertainty about the sources of lower crime are contentious debates about what should come next. How far can incarceration be reduced without endangering safety? Where is the proper line between aggressive, preventive policing and intrusive measures that alienate the law-abiding?The rise in incarceration has been even more striking than the decline in crime, leading to growing agreement on both the right and the left that it has gone too far. From the early 1970s to 2009, mainly because of changes in sentencing, the share of American residents in state or federal prison multiplied fourfold, reaching 1.5 million on any given day, with hundreds of thousands more held in local jails, although the rate has tapered off somewhat since 2009.The social and economic costs are now the subject of intense study. Some conservatives such as William G. Otis, a former federal prosecutor and adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University, argue that while many factors account for falling crime, harsher justice surely played a significant role.When people are incarcerated they are not out on the street to ransack your home or sell drugs to your high school kid, he said.But many criminologists say the impact has been limited.The policy decisions to make long sentences longer and to impose mandatory minimums have had minimal effect on crime, said Mr. Travis, of John Jay College. The research on this is quite clear.Higher imprisonment might explain from 10 percent to, at most, 25 percent of the crime drop since the early 1990s, said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. But it brought diminishing returns, he said, as those committing less severe crimes also received lengthy sentences.Many states, led by Republicans as well as by Democrats, have acted to reduce sentences for low-level and nonviolent crimes and to improve drug and other treatment services, while still bringing down crime rates.In the Congress, figures as varied as Senator Durbin and Republican senators including Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky have supported cuts in federal sentencing.Police methods entered the spotlight after the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York led to mass protests, followed by the murderous targeting of two officers in New York.Combined at its best with close public cooperation, the concentration of police resources on crime hot spots has been shown, in several studies, to reduce crime without simply pushing it elsewhere, said Daniel S. Nagin, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University.Methods used with success in New York City in the mid-1990s under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his police commissioner William J. Bratton have been widely imitated, including the mapping of crime and concentration of forces in trouble spots and use of CompStat data and meetings to hold local commanders accountable for crime in their precincts.John F. Timoney, who was No. 2 in the New York Police Department at the time and later headed police departments in Philadelphia and Miami, said new attention to seemingly minor crimes like public drunkenness and vandalism is also vital.Its the quality-of-life issues that dominate community meetings, he said. Pushing street officers to respond, under the so-called broken windows theory, won public support and sometimes headed off more serious criminal behavior, he said.But some say the tactics too often devolved into overly aggressive policing and the  policy at the center of controversy in New York, in which officers search young men, mainly black and Hispanic, on little pretext.In the wake of the police killings of unarmed black men in Missouri and New York, President Obama established a task force of police officials and experts that is expected to recommend increases in community policing, which has declined since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and other changes intended to repair the gulf between law enforcers and minorities as well as improve crime prevention.Given how poorly trends in crime were foreseen in the past, and the role of deeper social forces, there is no guarantee that crime rates will not rise again.But there is wide agreement on measures outside the scope of the criminal justice system that could foster further declines or blunt any rise, Dr. Nagin said. Enriching the early childhoods of high-risk children, expanding drug treatment programs and offering more mental health services are prime examples.One clearly bad option, Dr. Nagin said, is turning prisons into substitutes for mental hospitals.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "ERIK ECKHOLM", "title": "In a Safer Age, U.S. Rethinks Its Tough on Crime System  - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/with-crime-down-us-faces-legacy-of-a-violent-age-.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, announced on Tuesday the creation of a special office to help immigrants navigate the sometimes intimidating criminal justice system and to coordinate the prosecution of immigrant-related crime, including financial exploitation and violence.The initiative was spurred in part by the scheduled rollout in the coming months of sweeping federal immigration initiatives, which immigrants advocates and law-enforcement officials say may set off a surge in While the district attorneys office has frequently prosecuted cases involving the victimization of immigrants, Mr. Brown said the new entity, the Office of Immigrant Affairs, will sharpen and enhance those efforts.We recognize that with immigration policy changing and evolving on all levels of government, there is an opportunity to do more, he said in a statement.Queens is the third district attorneys office in New York City to have a unit dedicated to immigration issues. In 2007, Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney at the time, formed his offices Immigrant Affairs Unit. Last year, the Immigrant Fraud Unit in the Brooklyn district attorneys office was created.In recent months, immigrants advocates had been lobbying Mr. Brown to create a similar entity in his office to help increase the protection of immigrants in Queens, the borough with the largest immigrant population and the highest concentration of immigrants.Advocates say immigration fraud tends to spike with the implementation of any new immigration program. Furthermore, they say, the national debate over the past couple of years has both raised expectations and sowed confusion among immigrants, increasing their vulnerability to unscrupulous lawyers and others masquerading as authorized legal representatives.Those concerns increased in November when President Obama announced his executive actions on immigration, including the expansion of a deportation deferral program for immigrants brought to this country as children, scheduled to take effect next month.In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Brown emphasized that the decision to form the new office was driven in part by recent changes in local, state and national immigration policy, though he added, We heard, certainly, from the advocates, as well, and we found that it would be appropriate to do the kind of thing were doing now.Mr. Brown has appointed Carmencita N. Gutierrez, a senior Queens prosecutor and a daughter of Colombian immigrants, to be the director of the new office, which will include a paralegal.Ms. Gutierrez, who was raised in Queens, said part of her work will involve meeting with community groups and leaders to help demystify the work of the Queens district attorneys office and other law-enforcement agencies and direct victims to the right bureaus for help.Suspicion of government authorities is common among immigrants, particularly those who do not speak English or are undocumented. But Ms. Gutierrez said she hoped her offices outreach would help to dispel that wariness.We have been doing it individually when we meet victims, saying, Look, your status is not important to us, she said in an interview. Our goal is to educate the community on a grander scale.At the same time, the new office will work internally to help assistant district attorneys handle immigrant-related cases and navigate immigrant issues. Ms. Gutierrez said her office will serve as a main receptacle of information related to immigrant populations and crimes against immigrants.I think it will be a good opportunity to enhance our ability to handle cases of that nature, Mr. Brown said.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "KIRK SEMPLE", "title": "Queens Prosecutor Creates Office of Immigrant Affairs - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/nyregion/queens-prosecutor-creates-office-of-immigrant-affairs.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "Teenagers arrested for minor crimes will soon be diverted to counseling before they ever come before a judge under a new pilot program in Brooklyn and Manhattan, prosecutors said on Tuesday.The program will apply to 16- and 17-year-olds arrested for the first time for low-level offenses, like jumping a subway turnstile, shoplifting or trespassing, the Manhattan district attorney, , said.Those defendants will be offered a deal: Enter a counseling program run by the  and the charges will be dropped before arraignment, Mr. Vance said, speaking at a breakfast forum.Mr. Vance said a young person who had done nothing more serious than fail to pay a subway fare should not receive a trip downtown and a docket number, but a real intervention in his life, to put him on a positive path forward.The Brooklyn district attorney, Kenneth P. Thompson, said the pilot project would build on the success of a diversion program for teenagers started in 2013 in the Brooklyn arraignment courts by . That program in its first year diverted more than 160 teenagers charged with minor crimes into counseling.Mr. Thompson said the hope was to intervene even earlier, offering first-time offenders a chance to go to counseling before they even appear in court.Youths deemed eligible will go to two afternoon sessions of counseling at community justice centers, said Greg Berman, director of the Center for Court Innovation, a nonprofit that provides alternatives to incarceration. Some of the defendants will go through mock trials with other teenagers; others will be given individual counseling and community service.The pilot program will start in February in two police precincts: the 25th on the Upper West Side and the 73rd in Brownsville, Brooklyn. It will be evaluated after three to six months, Ms. Herman said.The project, tentatively called Project Reset, comes as public opinion has begun to waver on New York Citys prolonged crackdown on minor crimes.

At arraignment, prosecutors would usually agree to drop charges if the person avoids arrest for six months, a resolution known as adjournment in contemplation of dismissal.The new program will let police officers and prosecutors steer teenagers into counseling, leaving them with no criminal record if they complete it, Mr. Vance said.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "JAMES C.

{"body": " said in court papers this week that he had been ensnared in the case by his onetime boss, who, he contends, threatened to kill him if he failed to follow orders.The former sniper, Joseph Hunter, a 20-year veteran with Special Forces training, was arrested in an overseas sting operation by the  in September 2013 at his rented bungalow in Phuket, Thailand.After he was extradited to New York, prosecutors unsealed an indictment alleging that Mr. Hunter, who used the nickname Rambo, was the leader of a team of mercenary killers who planned to assassinate an agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration and a government informer for a group of men they believed were Colombian drug traffickers.Though prosecutors in New York eventually revealed that the traffickers were actually undercover operatives working with the D.E.A., they never disclosed that an international criminal who once employed Mr. Hunter as a bodyguard was the one who set them on Mr. Hunters trail and who helped start the sting operation. According to federal agents, that employer was a South African drug- and gunrunner named Paul Le Roux, who was  before he was arrested by the drug agency and became a cooperating witness.From the start, the case of Mr. Hunter has been full of cinematic moments and cloak-and-dagger twists. The government contends that he hired four former soldiers  three from Europe and one from the United States  to act as his accomplices and was recorded on tape agreeing to accept an $800,000 bounty to kill the two victims in Liberia. The assassins, prosecutors say, planned to wear custom rubber masks and then escape the country in a privately chartered jet.On Monday evening, Mr. Hunters lawyer, Marlon Kirton, filed a motion to dismiss the case, accusing the prosecution of outrageous government conduct for having used Mr. Le Roux as a cooperating witness. While the motion acknowledged that the use of informers is widespread in the federal courts, Mr. Kirton argued that it shocks the conscience that prosecutors used Mr. Le Roux in that capacity when, as the motion claimed, he threatened to kill Mr. Hunter and his family and, moreover, killed two unnamed associates in the past.In a redacted affidavit that accompanied the motion, Mr. Hunter said Mr. Le Roux had not only threatened his life, but also bragged that he had foreign law-enforcement officers and government officials on his payroll.Speaking out for the first time since his arrest  if only from jail and by way of the redacted affidavit  Mr. Hunter, 49, wrote that he was in constant fear that Mr. Le Roux would kill him or have him falsely arrested if I did not do his bidding. The affidavit added: Everyone was afraid of this man. I was afraid of this man.A spokeswoman for the United States attorneys office for the Southern District of New York, which is handling Mr. Hunters case, declined to comment on the documents on Tuesday. The prosecutors office has repeatedly declined to discuss Mr. Le Roux or his involvement with Mr. Hunter, who is facing life in prison if convicted.Two of Mr. Hunters co-defendants have recently pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges related to the case. One of them, Timothy Vamvakias, a former United States Army soldier, entered his guilty plea on Jan. 9. A second, Dennis Gogel, a veteran of the German armed forces, pleaded guilty on Tuesday. Both of their lawyers declined to comment on their pleas. Two other men, Michael Filter, from Germany, and Slawomir Soborski, from Poland, are accused of narcotics charges and conspiracy.

{"body": "New York City officials agreed on Tuesday to a plan that would eliminate the use of  for all inmates 21 and younger, a move that would place the long-troubled  complex at the forefront of national jail reform efforts.The policy change was a stark turnaround by the administration of Mayor , which recently eliminated the use of solitary confinement for 16- and 17-year-olds but, backed by the powerful correction officers union, had resisted curtailing the practice more broadly.Even the most innovative jails in the country punish disruptive inmates over age 18 with solitary confinement, said Christine Herrman, director of the Segregation Reduction Project at the Vera Institute of Justice. Ive never heard of anything like that happening anywhere else, she said, referring to the New York City plan. It would definitely be an innovation.The Correction Department has faced repeated criticism over the past year after  and neglect of inmates at Rikers, the countrys second-largest jail system. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York,  over the treatment of adolescent inmates at the jail complex.In the face of mounting scrutiny, the city has provided millions of dollars for better staffing and improved programs for inmates.A large body of scientific research indicates that solitary confinement is particularly damaging to adolescents and young adults because their brains are still developing. Prolonged isolation in solitary cells can worsen mental illness and in some cases cause it, studies have shown.Inmates in solitary confinement at Rikers are locked in their cells for 23 hours a day, with one hour of recreation, which they spend by themselves in a small caged area outdoors. A  in August by Mr. Bhararas office described the use of solitary cells for young people at Rikers as excessive and inappropriate. Inmates can be locked away for weeks and months and, in some cases, even over a year.As of Jan. 9, according to recently released city data, there were 497 inmates between ages 19 and 21 at Rikers, with 103 of them held in solitary confinement.The majority of inmates in the 18- to 21-year-old cohort are young men of color whom we presume innocent under our laws because they are awaiting trial, said Bryanne Hamill, one of the boards strongest voices for eliminating solitary for young inmates. The evidence showed that solitary confinement will not improve their future behavior, but will reliably convert anger and frustration today into rage and violence tomorrow.The plan to further reduce the use of solitary confinement was approved unanimously, 7 to 0, by the citys  on Tuesday morning and is supported by the correction commissioner, Joseph Ponte, who was appointed by Mr. de Blasio last year to spearhead reforms at Rikers. The change would not take effect until January 2016 and is contingent on obtaining financing for additional officers and clinical staff members.Jail reform advocates who have criticized the Correction Department for years praised the initiative. The New York Civil Liberties Union said the change would make Rikers a leader in solitary confinement reform.With these reforms, New York City has taken an important stand for basic human rights and reaffirmed its commitment to the safety of prisoners, prison staff and our communities, said Donna Lieberman, the organizations director. An institution as profoundly broken as Rikers Island will require wholesale reform to transform into a humane environment that emphasizes treatment and rehabilitation over punishment and isolation, and these rules are a major step forward.Norman Seabrook, president of the 9,000-member correction officers union, said the plan, which appeared to take him by surprise, would endanger correction officers, leading to more inmate attacks. He vowed to sue the board for every guard assaulted.Im deeply, deeply bothered by a decision that you would make, jeopardizing the safety and security of inmates and officers, he told the board on Tuesday.Union officials said they felt excluded from the discussions about solitary confinement.Its a blindside, said Sidney Schwartzbaum, who leads the union for assistant deputy wardens.Eighteen- to 21-year-olds are a very violent group, said Mr. Schwartzbaum, who added that he had not met with Mr. Ponte since mid-December. If we cant secure them, violence is going to go on unabated. What do we do with a guy who slashes someones throat?After years of wrangling between inmate advocates and city officials over solitary confinement, the agreement on Tuesday appeared to have been worked out in a private meeting between Mr. Ponte and Ms. Hamill. The two met on Monday morning at the behest of Mr. Ponte and spent 45 minutes developing the details of the initiative.Along with the changes to solitary confinement, the new initiative allows the department to open a new 250-bed housing unit for the most violent inmates, known as enhanced supervision housing.The unit will hold inmates with a history of violence, including those affiliated with gangs and who have assaulted officers or other inmates. They will be locked in their cells for 17 hours a day, rather than the standard 10 hours.Effective immediately, the new rules will reduce the maximum amount of time inmates age 18 and older can be sentenced to solitary confinement to 30 days, from 90. The department also will eliminate so-called owed time. In the past, inmates who left Rikers before completing their stint in solitary confinement returned there if they went back to the jail.For years, New York City has locked people up without the provision of adequate programs and treatment to change their thinking and their behavior, Mr. de Blasio said in a statement. We are pursuing evidence-based practices that will lead to a safer and more humane system.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr. Ponte said he was confident he would be able to get the necessary resources from the city to put the plan in place next year. Ultimately, he said, getting young inmates out of solitary confinement will drive down violence.The idea we lock people up for any length of time and dont provide them with programs or treatments does not lead to good outcomes, he said.

{"body": "The trial of Ross W. Ulbricht, safe to say, will be like few that have ever taken place in Federal District Court.Mr. Ulbricht, 30, has been accused of running a worldwide online black-market bazaar under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts, the name of a character from the book and movie The Princess Bride. The underground site was called Silk Road, where several thousand vendors sold drugs and other illicit goods anonymously and out of the reach of law enforcement, the government said.This is a case about a dark and secret part of the Internet that was home to an enormous marketplace for the sale of illegal drugs, Timothy T. Howard, a federal prosecutor, told the jury in Manhattan on Tuesday, in an opening statement.The case is rich in high-tech intrigue and complexity, but amid its novel technological aspects  Mr. Ulbricht faces charges that include narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering conspiracies  is another set of more traditional allegations: He is accused of soliciting the murders of six people he believed were threats to his online business.Mr. Ulbricht was willing to use threats and violence to protect his turf, Mr. Howard told the jury, adding that the defendants territory was not a city block or even a neighborhood but rather the entire world.Prosecutors have said their investigation found no evidence that any killings were carried out, or that anyone was harmed.Mr. Ulbricht has pleaded not guilty to the charges, some of them carrying a potential life sentence, and his lawyer, Joshua L. Dratel, has denied that Mr. Ulbricht was the mysterious Dread Pirate Roberts, or that he sought to orchestrate any murders. Mr. Dratel did acknowledge in his opening statement that Silk Road was his clients idea  a kind of experiment, Mr. Dratel said.He created it as a completely freewheeling, free-market site that could sell anything except a couple of items that were harmful, Mr. Dratel said. But after several months, the work became too stressful because of the sites popularity, and Mr. Ulbricht handed it off to others, Mr. Dratel said.Mr. Dratel said that Mr. Ulbricht was later lured back by those operators, who had learned they were under investigation, and became a perfect fall guy. Mr. Dratel suggested that someone else was Dread Pirate Roberts and had been the real puppet master behind the illegal operation and his clients arrest.Mr. Howard told the jury how the eBay-like enterprise was run on the so-called Tor network, a hidden part of the Internet where online activity can be kept anonymous. Transactions were conducted in Bitcoins, a form of electronic currency that is as anonymous as cash. His idea was to make illegal drug deals as quick and easy as ordinary online shopping, Mr. Howard said.He said Mr. Ulbricht took commissions on each sale, amounting to about $18 million in Bitcoins.Mr. Howard said the jury would also hear from an undercover agent who had infiltrated Silk Road and became a trusted member of its support staff.Supporters of Mr. Ulbricht, who is being held without bail, describe him as a principled idealist with libertarian leanings. In an interview recorded in 2012 through StoryCorps, the national oral history project, which appeared on YouTube, Mr. Ulbricht said he wanted to make a substantial positive impact on the future of humanity.Mr. Dratel and his co-counsel had sought unsuccessfully to preclude the government from introducing the murder-for-hire allegations, which were listed in the indictment as overt acts supporting the charge that Mr. Ulbricht ran a narcotics conspiracy. (Mr. Ulbricht was separately indicted in Baltimore on a murder-for-hire charge, a count that remains pending and is not part of the Manhattan indictment.)The government says Mr. Ulbricht solicited the murders to retaliate against a former staff member who he believed had stolen Bitcoins from the site and who he feared would provide information about the site to law enforcement, and to eliminate the threats posed by others who were threatening to publicly leak the names and addresses of Silk Road users and vendors.Prosecutors say that in 2013, for example, Mr. Ulbricht, as Dread Pirate Roberts, paid a user of the site, known as Redandwhite, to kill a Silk Road vendor who called himself FriendlyChemist and who had threatened to make public real names and addresses of Silk Road vendors and customers unless he received $500,000.What do u ... think will happen if thousands of usernames, ordr amounts, addresses get leaked? FriendlyChemist had written, adding that the vendors would be arrested and customers would leave the site, the government said.Mr. Ulbricht wrote to Redandwhite, called FriendlyChemist a liability and said, I wouldnt mind if he was executed, according to a government court filing.Ultimately, the filing says, Mr. Ulbricht paid Redandwhite $150,000 in Bitcoins and provided a name and location in White Rock, British Columbia, for FriendlyChemist, and Redandwhite later informed Mr. Ulbricht that the murder had been carried out. The criminal complaint noted that the Canadian authorities had no record of a homicide occurring near White Rock around that time.Mr. Ulbrichts mother, Lyn, in a recent appearance in New York with the filmmaker Alex Winter, who is making a documentary about the Ulbricht case and Silk Road, said her son was being smeared as some kind of thug all over the world, based on no evidence whatsoever.The office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan has also said that the murder-for-hire evidence would help prove Mr. Ulbricht was Dread Pirate Roberts, because private messages from Dread Pirate Roberts that solicited the murders matched evidence recovered from Mr. Ulbrichts laptop. This evidence, therefore, connects Ulbricht in the real world with Dread Pirate Roberts in cyberspace, the office wrote to the judge, Katherine B. Forrest.Several times during the governments opening, as the prosecutor described Mr. Ulbrichts role in Silk Road, the defendant could be seen shaking his head.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "BENJAMIN WEISER", "title": "Trial Over a Mans Role in a Black Market Begins - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/nyregion/trial-of-man-accused-of-founding-silk-road-an-online-black-market-is-set-to-begin.html", "date": "JAN. 13, 2015"},
{"body": "A New York State gambling board on Tuesday evening unanimously approved Gov. s request for a new round of bidding for a Las Vegas-style casino in the Southern Tier, a western region bordering Pennsylvania.The Gaming Facility Location Board reviewed 16 proposals for casino resorts in three regions north and west of New York City and recommended licenses for three projects on Dec. 17, but rebuffed two from the Southern Tier that it said were not viable.Governor Cuomo initially supported the decision, saying that a casino was not likely to spur economic development in the relatively sparsely populated area near Binghamton. But after hearing criticism from elected officials and local residents, Mr. Cuomo asked the board to consider a new round of bidding for a casino license specifically for the Southern Tier.At a board meeting Tuesday, Kevin Law, the chairman, said that he saw no harm in soliciting new proposals solely for the Southern Tier, as the governor suggested.At the meeting, Mr. Law noted that the board never said that two casinos in the Southern Tier-Finger Lakes region could not work. But he and the other members of the board emphasized that the new proposals had to be an improvement on the earlier projects.State legislation allows for up to four casino licenses outside of the New York City area. But in recommending only three projects for a license last month, the board warned about the possibility of cannibalizing an already crowded gambling market in the Northeast. The board could still decide not to award a license.On Tuesday, Mr. Law reiterated the boards decision to recommend a license for a $750 million casino resort near Monticello, in the Catskills; a $300 million project in Schenectady; and a $425 million gambling hall in the Finger Lakes area.But the Southern Tier is not the only area with impoverished communities hoping that a casino, or any other initiative, would spur a reversal of fortunes. Some of them are now demanding equal treatment with the Southern Tier.Judith L. Kennedy, the mayor of Newburgh, 70 miles north of New York City, sent a letter on Tuesday expressing strenuous objections that her onetime industrial city had been excluded from consideration for a fourth casino license. The unemployment rate in Newburgh is 8.5 percent, a good deal higher than the Southern Tier.We ask for a fair process that includes Newburgh where all proposals can be analyzed and vetted on the merits, the letter said.The developers behind a proposed $640 million casino project on the grounds of the now-defunct Nevele resort in the Catskills also asked for equal consideration for the fourth license, which they say is the last chance for Ellenville and for the iconic resort.The developer told the Gaming Commission that it was negotiating with a strong company, RatPac Entertainment  a joint venture of Brett Ratner, a Hollywood producer, and James Packer, an Australian billionaire and casino operator  to take over the project.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "CHARLES V.

{"body": "Troy Faux, 36, wanted brighter lights and longer benches around the basketball courts. Jose Rodriguez dreamed of new and improved sprinklers to entertain his 2-year-old daughter on hot summer days. And Jahiem Mewborn-Dozier, 9, longed for a roof over the basketball courts, as well as cellphone charging stations and barbecues.They were among dozens of residents who turned out to help brainstorm ideas for the renovation of Lyons Square Playground in the South Bronx. Lyons Square is one of 35 small, neglected parks and playgrounds across the city that will be  as part of Mayor s plan to address inequities in the park system.The meeting, held on Monday night in a community center a few blocks from the park, was itself part of the citys parks equity platform. The sessions are being offered in each of the communities where the parks are being refurbished. We are looking at equity as empowerment, said Jennifer Gardner, a senior project planner for the parks department. Thats one of the reasons were here  to gather your ideas.At 1.3 acres,  has a little more space than the other chosen parks. (Some of the 35 parks are less than a half acre.) But there are still constraints: noise from the nearby Bruckner Expressway, steeply sloping sides and an unusual shape.The plan calls for everything now there  the cracked basketball courts, dated play equipment and clogged sprinklers  to be ripped out. Were going to start from scratch, said Alison Shipley, a partner with , the landscape architects overseeing the redesign.For local residents, the meeting, technically called a scoping session, was a rare invitation into the urban planning process, a chance to put their visions of recreation and community on paper. For some, it was a long overdue opportunity to fix what they saw as a historic slight.Were the forgotten borough, said Mabel Gonzalez, a parent coordinator at nearby Public School 75, an elementary school. I would like to see trees, flowers, fellowship, safety, humanity.Ms. Gonzalez, 53, pointed out that Lyons Square, like many small parks in the boroughs outside Manhattan, was devoid of greenery. We like grass, she said. Puerto Ricans and Latinos like trees and grass, too.In opening remarks, Mitchell J. Silver, the parks commissioner, addressed the issue of equity head on. Lyons Square Playground, he said, was one of 215 parks in low-income neighborhoods that had less than $250,000 in capital improvements over 20 years.In choosing the parks for Mr. de Blasios effort, department staff members narrowed the list, based on site visits and metrics like population density and growth. You will have the chance to create a legacy for this park for the next 20 years, he told the groups who were arrayed around satellite photos and maps of Lyons Square.For all the lofty goals, however, much of the night was devoted to the nuts and bolts of open spaces and play areas. What makes them appealing to users of all ages and interests? How can you engineer a park so that dog walkers and aspiring basketball stars, senior citizens and toddlers want to spend time there?Jose and Katya Rodriguez were there for their three children, ages 2, 5 and 17. Mr. Rodriguez, who works in construction, said that he would like to see multiuse courts that can segue from soccer, for his 5-year-old son, Josue, to basketball, for his 17-year-old son, Jorm.For the whole family, he pressed for bathrooms, something the parks department said will be added for the first time to the park, which is slated to receive $4.5 million of the $130 million dedicated to the Community Parks Initiative.By the end of the session, Josue was sound asleep with his head on the table.Some of the tables had conflicting wish lists, and Ms. Gardner, the parks official, acknowledged those divergent visions after the tables moderators presented the ideas. We are hearing some potential conflicts and harmonies, she said at the meeting, adding that the concept plan would have to balance various needs.Basketball, a passion of many teenagers and young men who live near the park, emerged as a flash point.One group, for instance, lobbied for fewer basketball courts  there are now two regulation-size courts and three half courts  and more areas for passive recreation like chess tables, a performance area, lawns and seating. A nearby table was all about basketball, wanting to maximize the space for daytime and nighttime play.Some residents bemoaned the fact that the sport often seemed like the only activity offered to young people in disadvantaged neighborhoods.What people want isnt necessarily whats good for them, said Antony Montero, a graduate student at Lehman College in the Bronx and a crisis worker in a public elementary school. I used to play basketball there, and Ive seen a lot of injuries and a lot of fights.Mr. Montero envisioned a park free of basketball courts and instead filled with grass, flowers, tables for socializing and perhaps a track for a different athletic activity.Not everyone was ready to abandon basketball. Josh Rodriguez, himself an avid basketball player at the playground, thought the parks department should shrink the footprint of the basketball area in order to add a skate park. There are a bunch of kids who skate by the Hunts Point subway station, he said. They almost run people over.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "LISA W.

{"body": "Tom Esola has become a regular at a senior center in Midtown Manhattan, where he drops by two to three times a week to see friends, sit down to shepherds pie dinners, volunteer in the computer room and even try a tango lesson.But to get to the center, Mr. Esola, 64, has to take an hourlong ride on the D train from his home in Norwood, the last stop in the Bronx. Though he has tried senior centers in his own neighborhood, Mr. Esola, who is gay, said, I didnt identify with the people there, and has always returned to the Midtown center, which specifically serves people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender.Now Mr. Esola will have an option closer to home. , or SAGE, the organization that operates the Midtown center, is opening its first senior center for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the Bronx on Wednesday as part of a $1.5 million, city-funded expansion of L.G.B.T.-focused senior programs and support services across the five boroughs. The Bronx center will operate five days a week from rented space on the second floor of the  on East 188th Street. It will offer a range of social, cultural, art and health programs, as well as hot lunches.It is the largest investment of support services for L.G.B.T. elders in the citys history, said Ritchie Torres, a Bronx city councilman who is gay and who led the effort for city funding. Its hard to imagine a constituency that has been more invisible to city government and underserved by society at large.Mr. Torres and other supporters of the expansion contend that these people are more likely to be in need of help or support because they are often single, have no children and may be estranged from their families. About 100,000 of New York Citys 1.5 million residents who are 60 and older are believed to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, according to SAGE leaders and other advocates. Nearly one-third of that group is estimated to live in poverty.New Yorks Department for the Aging finances 250 senior centers across the city, and provides nearly $773,000 annually for the SAGE center in Midtown, which opened in 2012. As part of the expansion, SAGE received $1.2 million to open the new Bronx center, convert another SAGE site with limited programs in Harlem into a full-service senior center, and team up with community organizations in Brooklyn and on Staten Island to increase programs and services.The remaining $300,000 from the expansion is being used to support a center run by Queens Community House. The money has allowed the center, which was displaced by a fire last year, to hire a new assistant director, provide hot daily lunches and expand wellness and recreational offerings as it prepares to move to a permanent home.Donna M. Corrado, the commissioner of the Department for the Aging, said: The increased funding is recognition that more programs are needed to better serve the unique needs of the older L.G.B.T. community. SAGE offers a place where L.G.B.T. seniors can attend programming, socialize and obtain services in a safe space with people of similar interests and life experiences.Joyce Banks, 70, a Bronx resident, said that after her partner of 32 years died of cancer in 2013, she started going to the SAGE site in Harlem for comfort, companionship and help applying for financial assistance after losing her partners income. It was my home away from home, she said. Im not the friendliest person, but you cant dwell and sit in the house and become a recluse. You have to get up and out.The SAGE center in Midtown serves more than 1,500 people a year, about one-third of whom live outside Manhattan. Michael Adams, executive director of SAGE, said that many older lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people face discrimination or feel isolated in more traditional senior centers in their neighborhoods. What we hear is, We can go to senior center A or senior center B to get lunch, but were sitting by ourselves if were open,  Mr. Adams said. The fact is people should not have to travel an hour or two to get to a senior center that is welcoming and friendly to them.Some advocates and Bronx residents view the new center as long overdue in a borough where they say it has been especially difficult for those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. One of the citys most vicious anti-gay crimes took place in the Bronx in 2010 after members of a street gang called the Latin King Goonies lured a man to an apartment and then  for hours.Two years later, the boroughs only center for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents, the Bronx Community Pride Center, closed amid financial problems after its former leader, Lisa Winters, . Since then, a new community group, known as the , has been formed; it is providing limited services such as a free legal clinic as it raises funds for a permanent home.Im intent on making the Bronx much more gay-friendly, Councilman Torres said, adding that he has heard no opposition to the expansion of the services.In the Bronx, where advocates estimate there are about 16,800 older lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, the new center will serve up to 50 hot meals a day and host a reading club, yoga and tai chi lessons, a media room, and bilingual English-Spanish programs geared specifically to local residents. For instance, in a borough facing a crisis in obesity and diabetes, the center plans to have a nutritionist show people how to modify traditional family recipes to make them healthier.Geo Genao, 64, one of the centers four staff members, is an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who said he wanted to help others find a support network among people with similar experiences, the way he did. For me, to be gay in the Latino culture is very hard because the mentality they have about being gay is like, You are sick  its not something right,  Mr. Genao said.Mr. Esola, a retired banker who lives alone, said he plans to visit the Bronx center, especially on freezing days when he will welcome a shorter commute. He said he continues to face discrimination at times for being gay. Last year, he recalled, he was trying to pass two men on a sidewalk in Chelsea when they accused him of coming too close, called him gay, and pushed him hard enough that he fell to the ground.I just think straight people have been not that friendly to gay people, he said.

{"body": "More than 3.5 billion years ago, a meteor slammed into  near its equator, carving a 96-mile depression now known as Gale Crater.That was unremarkable. Back then, Mars, Earth and other bodies in the inner solar system were regularly pummeled by space rocks, leaving crater scars large and small.What was remarkable was what happened after the impact.Even though planetary scientists disagree on exactly what that was, they can clearly see the result: a mountain rising more than three miles from the floor of Gale.More remarkable still, the mountain is layer upon layer of sedimentary rock.The layered rock drew the attention of the scientists who chose Gale as the destination for NASAs Curiosity rover, a mobile laboratory the size of a Mini Cooper.Now, more than two years after arriving on Mars, Curiosity is climbing the mountain.In sedimentary rock, each layer encases the geological conditions of the time it formed, each a page from the book of Mars history. As Curiosity traverses the layers, scientists working on the $2.5 billion mission hope to read the story of how young Mars, apparently once much warmer and wetter, turned dry and cold in what John P. Grotzinger, the project scientist, calls the great desiccation event.Dr. Grotzinger remembers the first time he heard about Gale. I looked at it, and immediately Im like, This is a fantastic site,  he said. Whats that mountain in the middle?Officially, the name is Aeolis Mons, but mission scientists call it Mount Sharp in homage to , a prominent geologist and Mars expert at the California Institute of Technology who died in 2004.On Earth, mountains rise out of volcanic eruptions or are pushed upward by plate tectonics, the collision of pieces of the planets crust.Mars lacks plate tectonics, and volcanoes do not spew out of sedimentary rock. So how did this 18,000-foot mountain form?In the late 1990s, NASAs Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft was sending back images of the Martian surface far sharper than those from earlier missions, like Mariner and Viking.Kenneth S. Edgett and Michael C. Malin of Malin Space Science Systems, the San Diego company that built Global Surveyors camera, saw fine layered deposits at many places on Mars, including Gale. In 2000, they offered the hypothesis that they were sedimentary, cemented into rock.Indeed, Dr. Edgett said, it appeared that Gale Crater had been fully buried with sediment and that later winds excavated most of it, leaving the mountain in the middle.Imagine carving out of an expanse as large as 1.5 Delawares  a mound as tall, from base to peak, as Mount McKinley in Alaska, the tallest mountain in North America .Dr. Edgett asserts that that is plausible on Mars. He points to other Martian craters of similar size that remain partly buried. There are places where this did happen, so its not ridiculous to think this is what happened at Gale, he said.Still, in 2007 Gale had been discarded from the list of potential landing sites for Curiosity, because observations from orbit did not show strong evidence for water-bearing minerals in the rocks. NASAs Mars mantra for the past two decades has been Follow the water, because water is an essential ingredient for life.Dr. Grotzinger asked Ralph E. Milliken, then a postdoc in his research group at Caltech, to take a closer look at Gale. With data from an instrument on NASAs Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that can identify minerals in the rocks below, Dr. Milliken showed the presence of clays at the base of Mount Sharp as well as other minerals that most likely formed in the presence of water.The fact we have this mountain, and its not all the same stuff  the mineralogy is changing from one layer to the next  that gives us the hope that maybe those minerals are recording the interaction of the water and the atmosphere and the rocks, said Dr. Milliken, now a geologist at Brown.Were water conditions there becoming more acidic? Was there oxygen in the water? Thats something we can assess with the rover on the ground, Dr. Milliken said.Since its landing on Mars in August 2012, Curiosity took a detour to explore a section named Yellowknife Bay and discovered geological signs that Gale was once habitable, perhaps a freshwater lake.After that, the rover drove to Mount Sharp, with only brief stops for science. To date, the rover, operated by NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., has driven more than six miles, taken more than 104,000 pictures and fired more than 188,000 shots from a laser instrument that vaporizes rock and dirt to identify what they are made of.In September, Curiosity drilled its first hole in an outcrop of Mount Sharp and identified the iron mineral hematite in a rock. That was the first confirmation on the ground for a Gale mineral that had been first identified from orbit.When Curiosity reaches rocks containing clays, which form in waters with a neutral pH, that will be the most promising place to look for organic molecules, the carbon compounds that could serve as the building blocks of life, particularly if the rover can maneuver into a spot shielded from radiation. (It does not have instruments that directly test for life, past or present.)The orbiter also detected magnesium sulfate salts, which Dr. Milliken described as possibly similar to Epsom salts.That layer appears to be roughly as old as sulfates that NASAs older Opportunity rover discovered on the other side of Mars. If Mount Sharp sulfates turn out to be the same, that could reflect global changes in the Martian climate. Or they could be different, suggesting broad regional variations in Martian conditions.Were finally beginning the scientific exploration of Mount Sharp, Dr. Milliken said. That was the goal.Along the way, Curiosity may also turn up clues to the origins of Mount Sharp. While Dr. Edgett thinks Gale Crater filled to the brim before winds excavated the mountain, others, like Edwin S. Kite, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton who is moving to the University of Chicago as a professor, think the mountain formed as a mound, with winds blowing layers of sand together that then were cemented by transient water. Can you build up a pile like that without necessarily filling up the whole bowl with water? Dr. Kite said. Perhaps just a little bit of snow melt as the pile grows up.He said the layers of Mount Sharp dip outward at the edges, as in an accumulating mound; they are not flat, as would be expected if they were lake sediments subsequently eroded by wind.Dr. Grotzinger thinks that both could have happened: that Gale Crater partly filled, then emptied to form the lower half of Mount Sharp, and a different process formed the upper portion. A sharp divide between the upper and lower parts of the mountain is suggestive.On Monday, during a NASA telephone news conference, Dr. Grotzinger and other members of the science team described new data suggesting long-lived lakes in the crater. The deposits at Yellowknife Bay could have been part of an ancient lake filled by streams flowing from the crater rim. As Curiosity drove toward Mount Sharp, it appeared to be traveling down a stack of accumulated deltas  angled layers where river sediment emptied into a standing body of water  and yet it was heading uphill. That pattern could have occurred if the water level were rising over time, and Mount Sharp was not there yet.That does not mean Gale was continually filled with water, but it suggests repeated wet episodes. We dont imagine that this environment was a single lake that stood for millions of years, Dr. Grotzinger said, but rather a system of alluvial fans, deltas and lakes and dry deserts that alternated probably for millions if not tens of millions of years as a connected system.Ashwin Vasavada, the deputy project scientist, said that to explain the episodes of a lake-filled Gale crater, the climate system must have been loaded with water.But answers will remain elusive. Were not going to solve this one with the rover, Dr. Edgett said. Were not going to solve this one with our orbiter data. Were going to be scratching our heads a hundred years from now. Unless we could send some people there.As successful as the NASA Mars rovers have been, their work is limited and slow. Curiositys top speed is not quite a tenth of a mile per hour. What might be obvious at a glance to a human geologist, who can quickly crack open a rock to peer at the minerals inside, could take days or weeks of examination by Curiosity.Id like to think it would take only a few months, Dr. Edgett said of solving Mount Sharps mysteries, with a few people on the ground.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "KENNETH CHANG", "title": "Curiosity Rovers Quest for Clues on Mars - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/science/curiosity-rovers-quest-for-clues-on-mars.html", "date": "DEC. 8, 2014"},

If recycling the waste on his familys farm would help to save the world, he was happy to go along.Out back, machinery was breaking down the manure and capturing a byproduct called methane, a potent greenhouse gas. A huge Caterpillar engine roared as it burned the methane to generate electricity, keeping it out of the atmosphere.The $3.2 million system also reduces odors at , one of the largest in Wisconsin, but it would not have been built without a surprising source of funds: a California initiative that is investing in carefully chosen projects, even ones far beyond its borders, to reduce emissions as part of the battle against .When they came out here and told us they were willing to send us checks, we were thrilled, Mr. Pagel said.Californias program is the latest incarnation of an increasingly popular  and much debated  mechanism that has emerged as one of the primary weapons against global warming. From China to Norway, Kazakhstan to the Northeastern United States, governments are requiring industries to buy permits allowing them to emit set levels of greenhouse gases. Under these plans, the allowable levels of pollution are steadily reduced and the cost of permits rises, creating an economic incentive for companies to cut emissions.The system encourages companies to find the least expensive ways to make the cuts, either by adopting cleaner energy technology or by investing in outside emission-control projects, like the Pagels methane digester.Congress rejected a national plan of this type during President Obamas first term, but 10 states, including most of those in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, have developed their own programs. And the approach is expected to get a huge lift on Monday when Mr. Obama unveils a long-awaited national plan requiring states to lower their power plant emissions. One likely effect will be to encourage more states to adopt systems like Californias.Already, the approach is spreading worldwide, with the number of people living in places that have such a system nearing one billion, or 14 percent of the worlds population, including about 80 million Americans.The point now is to say, look, this can work, it can be scaled, and please join, said Frank A. Wolak, an economist at Stanford University.Yet in the decade it has been used to tackle global warming, this approach has had a turbulent history. The worlds largest such system, in Europe, has had severe problems, including gyrations in the prices that polluters have to pay. Given a lack of evidence that the system can actually solve the emissions problem, some environmental groups and scientists have developed serious reservations.The reason I dont support what were doing is not that I dont think something needs to be done, said Myles R. Allen, a leading British climate scientist at Oxford University. I just dont think its effective, and I dont see it ever being effective.Drought-plagued California, which Gov. Jerry Brown recently called the epicenter of climate change, hopes to prove that capitalism can work in the fight against global warming. The state took great care in setting up its system, which is now being seen as a global test case.Eighteen months into the venture, it is still too soon to tell how well it will work. But the state has so far managed to avoid some of the mistakes that have plagued efforts in other parts of the world. Hundreds of industrial facilities have been brought under the plan, prompting those businesses to study how to use less energy, and fuel suppliers will be pulled into it next year.By the end of the decade, the state is expected to collect about $5 billion a year in permit fees, with the bulk of the money being recycled into clean-energy projects.Worldwide, other approaches to global warming are also being considered. A more ambitious push could be made on renewable energy, like solar and wind. Power companies might be ordered to capture their carbon emissions and bury them underground. Forests could be preserved or allowed to regrow to absorb more carbon dioxide from the air.But all those methods have drawbacks, and interviews by The New York Times with more than 80 experts in nine countries revealed sharp disagreements about which to embrace.Experts say that limiting the effects of the human-induced warming will almost certainly cost trillions of dollars over generations and require an unprecedented level of cooperation across states and nations  if it can be done at all.How do we deal, as a global civilization, with a problem that is decades in the making and is caused by everything we do? asked Peter Miller, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco. Its the challenge of our time, and there is no road map.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body of scientists and other experts appointed by the United Nations, found last year that total emissions of carbon into the atmosphere must be kept below one trillion tons if global warming is to be held to tolerable levels. More than half that amount has been emitted since the beginning of the industrial era, and at the rate emissions are going up, the limit will be reached in 30 years or less.Already, the effects are being felt far and wide. A recent report, the , found that every corner of the United States was being hit hard, with more droughts in some regions, more torrential rains in others, worsening forest fires, melting land ice, and the deaths of millions of acres of trees from heat-loving insects.This month, the global stakes were made clear yet again when researchers  that ice sheets in the western section of Antarctica had begun an irreversible breakup that could ultimately raise the level of the sea by 10 feet or more.Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present, the National Climate Assessment said.Some environmental groups have contended that the best way to combat climate change would be for governments to impose tight regulations on businesses that produce greenhouse gases.Economists have argued, instead, that governments should put a price on emissions. The simplest way to do that would be a tax  the same sort of sin tax applied to liquor and cigarettes, albeit on a vastly larger scale.In the 1960s, economists in Canada and the United States developed an alternative concept: a market in pollution rights, which they believed would allow companies to decide for themselves how to limit their emissions at the lowest cost.That approach got its first major tryout in 1990 when the administration of George Bush embraced it to battle acid rain, persuading reluctant congressional Democrats to go along. It reduced emissions of sulfur dioxide far more cheaply than expected, and it was seen as a triumph of conservative thinking about the environment.The strategy, called , is now being applied to greenhouse gases. Governments impose a limit, or cap, on the amount of the gases that can be spewed into the atmosphere by polluters like power plants and refiners. It then issues permits, often called carbon allowances, equal to the level of the cap, with each permit representing a ton of emissions.The government requires industries to acquire enough permits to equal their emissions. Companies that need permits buy them, either from the government or on a commodity market, with the value set by supply and demand. Over time, the government reduces the cap and the number of permits, driving up their value.The system is intended to ensure that polluters reduce their emissions, but do it in a way that makes the most financial sense. A company might spend money to upgrade to more efficient equipment, for instance, if that is less expensive than buying permits at the market price at that time. The sale of permits also creates a flow of funds to reduce emissions in economic sectors not covered by the permit system, such as farming or forestry.Over the past decade, carbon allowances have become the worlds newest commodity. Thousands of people  in small offices in San Francisco, on trading floors in Houston, at power stations all over Europe  now buy and sell the permits every day. They are not all representing polluters; some are simply speculators placing bets on what will happen to carbon prices over time. , a research firm, expects permits representing more than nine billion tons of emissions to trade hands this year, with a transaction value of nearly $90 billion.Yet a few of these government-created markets have been seriously flawed, and some experts argue that time is being wasted on an effort that could, ultimately, fall short.While the United States has been embroiled in a political argument over the past decade about whether climate change is even real, the European Union has largely embraced the science and moved forward. The European Emissions Trading System, which went into operation in 2005, has proved that a market in pollution permits can be made to work across barriers of language and national interest. Yet the European Union has also come to be seen as a case study in what can go wrong if such a system is not set up carefully.Early on, instead of scrutinizing data on emissions, European regulators trusted companies to tell them how much greenhouse gas they were emitting. Since those numbers would be used in setting the initial emissions cap, the companies had an obvious incentive to exaggerate. When it finally became clear in 2006 that they had done so, and emissions were actually lower than traders had been led to believe, permits suddenly became less valuable and their price crashed in a matter of hours.Then, just as Europe was tightening its rules, the global financial crisis hit in 2008 and 2009. You produced less electricity, less steel, less toilet paper  less of everything that was included in the system, said Stig Schjolset, chief carbon markets analyst with Thomson Reuters Point Carbon in Oslo.The European Union had put no mechanism in place to respond to these changing economic conditions, so governments kept cranking out carbon permits even as the decline in output meant that fewer were needed. Carbon prices tanked yet again.Recently the European Union adopted changes that have firmed up prices somewhat. But at just over $7 per ton of carbon dioxide, they are still far below their peak, and below the $30 level that many analysts believe is needed to spur investment in cleaner energy sources.Moreover, the Europeans have yet to agree on long-term emission targets that would drive up carbon prices and reward investors in clean energy, though proposals are under discussion. Through the 2020s, there is no clear signal about how the cap will tighten, said Adrian Gault, chief economist with Britains national , which advises the government on the problem.Europes broader goals have by no means been a complete failure. The European Union set a target of lowering emissions 20 percent by 2020, and that appears likely to be met  but several studies suggest that is less a result of the carbon market than of economic weakness, as well as subsidies for renewable power. Many experts in Europe fear that later, more ambitious goals will prove unattainable if companies have too little incentive to invest in clean technology. The experts believe emissions throughout the developed world need to fall 80 percent or more by 2050.Even if were fine to meet the emissions target for 2020, it will be very challenging to meet Europes long-term targets, Mr. Schjolset said. For that, you need a higher carbon price now.Mary Nichols cut her teeth as a young lawyer by successfully suing the California state government for violating the federal . She has long since become an insider, running the most powerful state environmental agency in the country, Californias Air Resources Board.Ms. Nichols  chosen by a Republican governor and kept on by the Democrat who succeeded him  said that when her agency set out to create a carbon market, her European counterparts were candid in advising the state how not to repeat their mistakes. It was an act of great generosity on their part, she said.Californias Global Warming Solutions Act, signed in 2006 by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, set a goal of lowering Californias greenhouse gases in 2020 to the 1990 level, a cut of 28 percent from the level they had been expected to reach in 2020 without the law.Even after it was signed, the law was the subject of political and legal battles, with  companies and other polluters fighting to overturn it. When voters were asked whether they wanted the state to tackle global warming in 2010, they voted 62 percent to 38 percent to move forward with the law, which requires more efficient cars, more renewable power on the states electric grid and many other steps. A centerpiece was a provision capping emissions from big polluters, including power generators and gasoline refiners, and setting up a permit-trading system.California spent several years developing regulations, then began its cap-and-trade system in 2013. The project is taking hold gradually. California adopted rules shielding companies vulnerable to out-of-state competition, as well as residential electricity customers, from the full impact of the costs. In the early days, it is giving away many of the required carbon permits for free to ease companies into the system.Nonetheless, at just over $11 a ton, the carbon price in California is now the highest in any cap-and-trade market, 60 percent above the price in Europe.In setting up the market, California took measures to prevent the wild price gyrations seen in Europe. The state spent years getting accurate emissions data, for instance. And it established de facto floor and ceiling prices for its permits. The price so far has been highly predictable, trading in a range from $11 to $14 a ton.As part of its plan, the state decided to allow emission-lowering projects in sectors not covered by the cap-and-trade system, such as forestry and farming. These offset projects, which can be located anywhere in the United States, are subject to strict auditing. The projects create credits that can be sold in the California market.New companies have sprung up to serve as middlemen, helping farmers, forest owners and others set up eligible offset projects. One of those companies,  of San Francisco, matched the Pagel dairy farm in Wisconsin with Californias money.John T. Pagel, the owner, said that he had thought for several years about installing a system to reduce odors and capture methane emissions from the manure of thousands of cows. But he could not figure out how to make the economics work. Its the right thing to do, but it has to support itself, too, Mr. Pagel said.Then he met a TerraPass representative at an agricultural fair several years ago and learned he could receive payments totaling tens of thousands of dollars a year.On a tour of his farm near Kewaunee, Mr. Pagel proudly showed off the gear. A 20-cylinder Caterpillar engine, powered by methane from cow manure, throbbed in a large building behind his barns. As it turned a generator, it was pumping enough renewable power into the local electric grid to supply about 1,200 homes.I love that thing! Mr. Pagel said.One of his sons, Bryan, described meticulous oversight from California, including instruments that send a stream of data back to TerraPass headquarters to verify that the system is working properly. Otherwise, said Peter Freed, a former TerraPass employee who helped set up the deal, the state might disallow the carbon credits. The California system doesnt have a real tolerance for error, he said.Still, it will not be clear for years how successful the states carbon market has been in lowering emissions, or in spurring investment in clean energy. In the meantime, the Obama administration must decide how hard to push other states toward copying Californias program.Whats good for California, and what others will ultimately look to, is success, said Richard Corey, chief executive of the Air Resources Board. The ultimate test of success is going to be: Did it work?Some environmental groups and academics have never reconciled themselves to the idea of a market in pollution rights, and Europes problems have heightened their doubts. So far, they point out, global emissions are still rising.I would throw the markets out and start over with something different, said Doreen Stabinsky, a professor of global environmental politics at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Me. I think we cant be sidetracked by playing around with a market, because this objective is so important, so pressing and so difficult.Economists and analysts who support cap and trade say they are confident the problems can be worked out, and they believe California is in the process of proving it. The key issue now, they say, is whether governments that adopt these systems will tighten the emissions caps, driving up carbon prices  and do it soon enough to make a real dent in global warming.A second carbon market operating in the United States shows that the gradual lowering of emissions targets can have an impact. That system, known as the , started with far more modest goals than Californias, covering a smaller segment of the economy, and for much of its history carbon prices were below $2 a ton.But the system has worked smoothly for several years, generating $1.7 billion that nine state governments in the Northeast have used largely to support clean-energy projects. Those investments, as well as utilities switch to cleaner natural gas, have sharply reduced carbon emissions in the region.Recently, the nine states decided to cut their emissions cap by 45 percent and to let carbon prices rise. They have nearly doubled, to $4 a ton, and the revisions are expected to spur still more clean-energy investment.Some experts believe that in the long run, carbon markets will make a substantial contribution only if they can be tied together across political boundaries. That would allow polluters to search the world for the cheapest ways of cutting emissions.To a limited extent, such networking has already begun. Europe has allowed billions to  to developing countries, underwriting projects that have, for example, helped poor families switch to more efficient coal-burning stoves. California and Quebec have tied their markets together, and trading between them began early this year.The worlds biggest carbon polluter, China, has begun experimenting with markets in seven cities and provinces, with a view toward forming a national carbon market this decade. Both California and Europe are tentatively speaking to the Chinese about future linkages.As such developments take hold, the once unthinkable has begun to seem plausible, if by no means inevitable: a linked global carbon price high enough to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.We might be witnessing the birth of a new system, without quite realizing it, said Glen P. Peters, a climate researcher at the  in Oslo. When you think of all these bottom-up initiatives around the world, maybe we are living through the transformation right now.Experts who support cap and trade contend that a market mechanism can reach more deeply into the economy than any other approach, changing the behavior even of people and companies that might not necessarily care about global warming.The Wisconsin dairymen perhaps serve as an example of that.Even as the methane-powered generator roared on his property, John T. Pagel said he was not convinced that the climatic changes happening in the United States were a result of human emissions. He suspects they might be part of a natural cycle. But with Californians dangling cash in exchange for his willingness to cut emissions, he jumped at the chance to build his digester.We are doing exactly what they asked us to do to get paid to reduce carbon, Mr. Pagel said.

{"body": "TEQUESTA, Fla.   On their way home from an SAT tutoring session, the Van Dresser twins, Alexandra and Samantha, 17, popped into Tan Fever & Spa, a small family-owned salon tucked into a strip mall between a bar and a supermarket.They wanted to get tan before the prom, and the salon was the perfect combination of fast and cheap: Twenty minutes in a tanning bed cost just $7.Its the quickness of the tanning bed, Alexandra explained one afternoon last year. We dont have time to lay out on a beach.Indoor tanning might seem like a fashion that faded with the 1980s, but it remains a persistent part of American adolescence, popular spring, summer and fall but especially in winter, when bodies are palest. Salons with names like Eternal Summer and Tan City dot strip malls across the country, promising prettiness and, in some cases, better health, despite a growing body of evidence that links indoor tanning to skin cancer.Here in the Sunshine State, there are more tanning salons than McDonalds restaurants, CVS stores or Bank of America branches,  by University of Miami researchers.For decades, researchers saw indoor tanning as little more than a curiosity. But a  published last year estimated that tanning beds account for as many as 400,000 cases of skin cancer in the United States each year, including 6,000 cases of melanoma, the deadliest form.And clinicians are concerned about the incidence rate of melanoma in women under 40, which has risen by a third since the early 1990s, according to data from the National Cancer Institute. (Death rates have not gone up, however, a testament to earlier detection and better treatment.)Were seeing younger and younger patients coming to us with skin cancer, said Dr. Eleni Linos, assistant professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco. That is a new phenomenon.As such worrying signs have accumulated, tanning has emerged as a serious public health concern. Last year, the surgeon general called on Americans to reduce their exposure to the sun and tanning beds to prevent skin cancer, and the Food and Drug Administration invoked its most serious risk warning, lifting tanning beds from a category that included Band-Aids to that of potentially harmful medical devices. The Obama administrations 2010 health care law imposed a little-noticed 10 percent tax on tanning salons.And more than 40 states now have some sort of restriction on the use of tanning salons by minors, according to AIM at Melanoma, an advocacy and research group based in California, the first state to adopt a ban on minors in 2011. At least nine states plus the District of Columbia (pending congressional approval) have passed such bans, even Republican-controlled Texas, where antipathy to government regulation runs deep.The tide is turning, said Samantha Guild, director of public policy at AIM. States are saying: We dont have to go out on a limb on our own. Theres broad support for this issue. For the first time,  in the use of indoor tanning among teenage girls, dropping to about a fifth of them in 2013, from a quarter in 2009. Gery P. Guy Jr., a researcher with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who analyzed the data, which was released in December, attributed the decline to greater awareness and tougher laws.Even so, public health experts say tanning remains a persistent problem, especially among white teenage girls, a full third of whom say they have tanned indoors, more than the share who smoke cigarettes.There were about 14,000 salons across the country as of early 2014, according to John Overstreet, executive director of the  That does not count tanning beds in gyms and beauty parlors. The number is down by about a fifth in recent years, he said, as the recession eroded young womens disposable income and the tax imposed under the new health care law squeezed salons profits.Mr. Overstreet argues that there is no science that conclusively links moderate, nonburning ultraviolet ray exposure to melanoma. His organizations mission, according to its website, is to protect the freedom of individuals to acquire a suntan.The folks who dont like this industry are exaggerating the risks, he said, adding: Its just like anything in life. If you get too much of it, its bad for you.Evidence of the link between melanoma and ultraviolet exposure may have been inconclusive a decade ago, but recent research, including fresh data from the Cancer Genome Atlas, a federally funded program that is cataloging genetic mutations responsible for cancer, bolsters the case for the link.Dr. Jeffrey E. Gershenwald, a leader of the melanoma Atlas project, said studies to date showed that a majority of melanomas initially arising on the skin contain mutations associated with ultraviolet exposure. As for burning, , and still found an increased risk from indoor tanning.Theres no longer a question of whether UV is important, said Dr. Gershenwald, the medical director of the Melanoma and Skin Center at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Genomics has been transformative in our understanding of melanoma.The problem with indoor tanning, researchers say, is that many of those who do it, do it a lot. The federal government has collected data on tanning among high school students only since 2009, but researchers were surprised at the findings: Among those who used tanning beds, more than half had used them 10 times or more in the past year, according to Dr. Guy.Alan Geller, a senior lecturer at the Harvard School of Public Health, said, Weve been astounded by how many young people are using tanning beds and how often they are using them.Heather Champion, who manages a beauty salon in Palm Beach, Fla., said she had tanned so often in high school in upstate New York that her tanning card, which listed her visits, often needed additional pages, like a world travelers passport.There were some days I would go twice, she said.Four years ago, at age 26, she learned she had melanoma. The doctors caught it early and removed the cancer, but she still has to monitor her skin. Now she looks at herself in family pictures from those years and cringes. I was so much tanner than everyone else. Its just weird.There is strong peer pressure to be tan, particularly in small-town high schools. Sarah Hughes started tanning at 16, during beauty pageant season in her hometown, Dothan, Ala. She often tanned five days a week, paying with money earned working at Pier One Imports. In her senior year, she got a job at a tanning salon so she could tan for free.Living in a small town in southern Alabama, you dont want to be the oddball out, said Ms. Hughes, who is now 30 and works as a loan processor in a bank.Over time, she came to crave it.People did drugs. People had eating disorders. I tanned, she said.Joel Hillhouse, director of the Skin Cancer Prevention Laboratory at East Tennessee State University, said such compulsive behavior is not uncommon. A small share in a survey he conducted even admitted to stealing money and breaking into tanning salons to tan.Ms. Hughes stopped tanning at 25 when a doctor diagnosed advanced melanoma. A tumor on her left leg had grown down into her muscle and, eventually, her lymph nodes. In all, she had 33 spots removed, including eight melanomas over two years, a searing experience.She survived. Brandi Dickey, from Fort Worth, did not. Her mother, Paula Pittsinger, blames the near constant tanning from the age of 14 to 28, when she was found to have a particularly aggressive form of cancer that eventually spread throughout her body to her brain. She died in October at 33 after 18 surgical procedures, including six on her brain. There was no history of melanoma in her family.When you see the impact, the brain surgeries, the scars, when you see what tanning has done, it has got to hit home that its just not worth it, Ms. Pittsinger said.It was not always desirable to be tan. For generations, parasols and the pale skin they protected were signs of upper-class privilege. Being tan was like having calluses  something associated with working-class people who toiled in jobs that exposed them to the sun, according to Suntanning in 20th Century America, a social history of tanning by Kerry Segrave, published in 2005.But in the early 1900s, the medical profession began to promote the health benefits of tanning. Workers were increasingly moving into factories where complexions grew pallid, as the upper classes spent more time outside playing sports. By the 1920s, a tan had become fashionable, surfacing in conversations among affluent society types in F. Scott Fitzgerald novels. A character, Maury Noble, mused in The Beautiful and Damned, published in 1922: I did use to get a pretty good tan. I used to get a sort of bronze, if I remember rightly.The 1929 girl must be tanned, an article in Vogue proclaimed, Mr. Segrave reported.Indoor tanning exploded in popularity in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. Dr. June K. Robinson, a professor of dermatology at Northwestern Universitys Feinberg School of Medicine, remembers being handed a bright orange flier for free tans in downtown Chicago in the early 1980s.Im waiting for the light to change, and Im saying to myself this is the stupidest thing Ive ever heard of, she said.Many factors, including genetics, are at play with skin cancer. But exposure to ultraviolet light causes a majority of cases, and scientists have been trying to gauge how big a role indoor tanning plays. A panel of experts convened by the World Health Organization  that the use of sun beds before age 30 was associated with a 75 percent increase in the risk of melanoma.  found a 15 percent increase in the risk of certain skin cancers with every four sessions in a tanning bed before age 35.Mr. Overstreet contends that more people may be finding melanomas because more people are going to the doctor to look for them.Experts say the increase is real, and not just a matter of better detection.  are rising just as fast    and rates are also up among the uninsured, who would be less likely to get medical checkups.Many young women said in interviews that tanning fed a craving to be pretty, at a time in life when it is most acute. Madison, 21, a student at the University of Rhode Island, said tanning made her feel more confident and more comfortable when I walk around.Sometimes it makes me feel thinner, she continued. It has all these weird effects that just make me feel better about myself.She recently reduced her use to a few times a month, down from almost daily, honoring a request from her mother.Id love to stop tanning, but I cant, said Madison, who asked that her last name not be used because she felt self-conscious about the issue. Confidence is such a touchy aspect of a girls life. It takes a lot of time and practice. Im just not there yet.The C.D.C.s national youth survey found that indoor tanning often goes along with binge drinking and unhealthy weight-control practices. Among teenage girls, it was associated with illegal drug use and having sex with four or more partners, and among boys with the use of steroids, daily cigarette smoking and attempted suicide. Boys also tan indoors, but their numbers are a small fraction of the total.Some experts say combating the problem is a matter of raising awareness about the dangers of tanning. But many women said in interviews that they were aware of health risks but cared more about how they looked now.If I get skin cancer Ill deal with it then, said Elizabeth LaBak, 22, a student at Westfield State University in Massachusetts. I cant think about that now. Im going to die of something.The Van Dresser twins in Florida say they slather their moles with sunscreen before they get in a tanning bed. They even joined a melanoma awareness club in their high school. But the pressure to be tan is strong, and they find it hard to resist. Its what teens do, Samantha said. Especially in Florida.The new state laws restricting tanning by teenagers seem to be having some effect. According to Dr. Guy, the C.D.C. researcher, female students in states that require a combination of parental permission or other age restrictions are 40 percent less likely to tan indoors. Ms. LaBak, the college student from Massachusetts, said fewer women on campus tan now. All the Victoria Secret models are pale now, she said.Even so, salons persist.  on campus or in off-campus housing, University of Massachusetts medical school researchers reported in October.

{"body": "The thermal imaging systems used by the French police to find the two brothers suspected in the  last week are based on a rapidly evolving technology now turning up in hospitals, airports, and even smartphones.Like GPS, thermal imaging was once used exclusively by military and law enforcement. In the early 1990s, National Guard aircraft relied on thermal sensors to look for illegal drug activity at the Branch Davidian Compound in Waco, Tex.In 2013 a Massachusetts State Police helicopter used thermal imaging to locate the Boston bombing suspect , after a homeowner reported that the bloodied fugitive was hiding in a boat in his yard.In June last year, a military surveillance aircraft equipped with infrared sensors played a key role in , a fugitive who had killed three police officers in Moncton, New Brunswick. The cameras found him hiding in deep brush late at night.While humans see reflected light, all objects that surround us  other people, animals and even cold objects such as ice  give off heat, radiation beyond the visible spectrum that can be imaged in the form of a heat signature. A human body usually gives off more heat than the surrounding field, so it stands out.Unlike night-vision devices, which amplify small amounts of visible light, thermal imaging cameras rely on sensors known as microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS, to make images from heat.Thermal imaging cameras are made up of a large array of exotic MEMS devices, as well as specialized optics. Conventional glass and plastic lenses cannot be used because they block heat. Instead, these cameras require special lenses manufactured of transparent silicon.Long used by the military for surveillance, thermal imaging has raised privacy concerns. In 2001, the Supreme Court ruled that the use of sensors by the police to detect marijuana plants growing inside a home violated civil liberties because it constituted an unreasonable search.Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in  that the thermal imaging sensors could reveal things that the average person standing outside a home would not be able to determine  for example whether the lady of the house might be taking her daily sauna and bath.Yet despite Fourth Amendment restrictions, the technology has rapidly found its way into low cost-commercial applications where there are no clear legal barriers., a software company started by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has equipped a fleet of vehicles with thermal imaging sensor arrays that make it possible to quickly map energy efficiency in neighborhoods of household and commercial buildings.At  of Wilsonville, Ore., the worlds largest maker of thermal imaging gear, military and government customers once accounted for 70 percent of sales; today that figure is roughly 30 percent. The company, which had $1.5 billion in revenue in 2013, now makes thermal imaging cameras for consumers that cost less than $300.Our target is the do-it-yourself homeowner, said Andy Teich, FLIRs chief executive. The company also sells a thermal imaging system that connects to smartphones and allows homeowners to hunt for cold air leaks and plumbing problems.Mr. Teich said he kept an obsolete military GPS system in his office to remind him of the parallels between that technology and thermal imaging. Once used just in military missiles and planes, GPS receivers are now standard in many consumer devices.Thermal imaging technologies have now also become part of the arsenal used to halt the spread of disease. Infrared cameras at airports detect high body temperature as passengers pass through airport terminal checkpoints.The cameras, which can detect changes in body temperature as small as one-tenth of a degree Fahrenheit, were initially used in Southeast Asia in response to outbreaks of SARS and bird flu, and more recently to alert officials to individuals who might have contracted Ebola.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "JOHN MARKOFF", "title": "Thermal Imaging Allows for Picturing the Invisible - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/13/science/picturing-the-invisible.html", "date": "JAN. 12, 2015"},
{"body": "West Virginia joined 25 other states several years ago to help develop a set of standards for teaching science across the United States. Among other topics, the standards acknowledge the overwhelming scientific consensus that  is real and has been profoundly affected by human activity.And last month, the West Virginia Board of Education announced that it was among the first 13 states and the District of Columbia to adopt the , which  would equip students with the critical thinking and analytical skills they need to be successful in college and to compete for todays most rewarding jobs.But before the standards were adopted, board members quietly made some changes that science educators say substantially weaken the current state of climate science and introduce far more doubt than is warranted.The boards decision has come under fire and at a meeting scheduled for Wednesday the board will reconsider its action. The board could decide to go back to the original language of the curriculum, to do nothing or to drop the new standards altogether.The changes go far beyond mere tweaks and have importance beyond the boundaries of West Virginia, said Minda Berbeco, programs and policy director for the , based in Oakland, Calif.They are taking the standards, they are calling it the next-generation science standards, and they are changing the composition of the science to match their own personal views, she said. That defeats the purpose of having standards developed by scientific advisory boards.L. Wade Linger Jr., the board member who asked for the changes, said in an interview that members had improved the curriculum. We simply added some balance, to get the politics out of it, he said. Adding balance to the classroom is a good thing, not a bad thing.One part of the altered standards, , told sixth graders to ask questions to clarify evidence of the factors that have caused the rise in global temperatures over the past century. Mr. Linger had and fall added after the rise.He said he had called for the inclusion of and fall because satellite data shows temperatures going up and down. We shouldnt be having a standard that implies theres just a steady rise in temperature, as opposed to what the data shows, which is the temperature rises and falls all the time.The changes also call for discussion of Milankovitch cycles, which are extremely long-term variations in climate. Those cycles are often cited by people who deny the scientific underpinnings of climate change and note that factors other than human actions can also have a powerful effect on the climate.Mr. Linger, who is a technology entrepreneur, said he had come to his conclusions about warming after doing research on the Internet and comparing data from satellites, weather balloons and ground sensors over time. Last month, Mr. Linger told The Gazette, Were on this global warming binge going on here.Amy Hessl, a professor of geography at West Virginia University who studies climate change, said that while temperatures might vary from year to year, the overall trend over time clearly shows warming.Ms. Hessl said she taught her students about Milankovitch cycles  but to prove the human effects on climate, not to disprove them. According to the science of those cycles, the earth should be in a stable period or even a period of cooling, she said.Mr. Lingers arguments, she said, were exactly what the problem is with regard to teaching our students. Students need to have the understanding, and the ability, to discuss these things in an intelligent way, she added.Ms. Hessl said she was unimpressed with the argument that the changes in the curriculum introduced balance, which she compared to bringing someone into the classroom who says smoking is actually good for your health.Bobbi Nicholson, a professor of education at Marshall Universitys graduate school in South Charleston, criticized the board, saying that they see their primary constituency not as West Virginia students, but as the fossil fuels industry.Mr. Linger said that being accused of doing the work of the states powerful coal interests was a little frustrating, considering that he had no connection with the industry.The board, he said, acts in the best interest of the kids, and adhered to its usual processes, including a 30-day public comment period and a vote by the full board.The West Virginia Science Teachers Association, however, issued a statement complaining that although it had been involved with previous stages of the process, the board made these final changes unilaterally, without consulting or informing it.The science was compromised by these modifications to the standards, the teachers group stated in a letter signed by its president, Libby Strong.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "JOHN SCHWARTZ", "title": "West Virginia Revisits Science Standards - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/13/us/west-virginia-revisits-science-standards.html", "date": "JAN. 12, 2015"},
{"body": "A nationwide  last fall sent droves of children to emergency departments. The infections have now subsided, as researchers knew they would, but they have left behind a frightening mystery.Since August, 103 children in 34 states have had an unexplained, poliolike  of an arm or leg. Each week, roughly three new cases of so-called  are still reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Is the virus, called enterovirus 68, really the culprit? Experts arent certain: Unexplained cases of paralysis in children happen every year, but they are usually scattered and unrelated. After unusual clusters of A.F.M. appeared this fall, enterovirus 68 became the leading suspect, and now teams of researchers .Its unsatisfying to have an illness and not know what caused it, said Dr. Samuel Dominguez, an epidemiologist and an infectious disease specialist at Childrens Hospital Colorado, which has had the largest cluster of patients.For many families, the onset of persistent limb paralysis has been a bewildering experience. Roughly two thirds of the children with A.F.M. have reported some improvement, according to the C.D.C. About a third show none. Only one child has fully recovered.In August, Jack Wernick, a first grader in Kingsport, Tenn., developed a crummy little cold, said his father, Dan Wernick, who works for a paper company. It seemed ordinary, until Jack complained that his right arm was heavy, his face began drooping and pain started shooting down his right leg.On Aug. 29, his parents rushed him to East Tennessee Childrens Hospital. By then, he couldnt lift his arm, Mr. Wernick said.The doctors were perplexed, as his paralysis didnt quite fit any neurological condition they had seen. Then Dr. Christopher Miller, a consulting neurologist, read a new C.D.C. advisory describing limb paralysis in children.The alarm bells went off, he said.Today, Jack still cannot lift his right arm, though he never lost use of the affected leg. He is adapting well, but his mother, Nicole Wernick, says she worries that he will never be able to tie his shoes again or drive when he is older.Ive run out of tears, she said.Parents like her are desperate for scientists to identify the cause, and they are already pursuing a number of theories. But the research will be slow and painstaking.And while enterovirus 68 is the prime suspect, the C.D.C. has not ruled out another infectious cause, said Mark A. Pallansch, the director of viral diseases.Jack Wernick and many other affected children have never tested positive for infection with enterovirus 68. Last week, researchers said they  in the spinal fluid of 71 children with limb paralysis. In cases of , we routinely find virus in the spinal fluid or the stool, said Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, the director of  at Childrens Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo. She suggested the spines gray matter may be damaged not by the virus, but by an .If researchers cannot find a virus itself in partly paralyzed children, they can look for its footprint:  to enterovirus 68 in the blood. But first, the C.D.C. had to create an antibody test and make sure it was reliable. Thats the hard part, Dr. Pallansch said.The process required that researchers figure out how widespread antibodies for enterovirus 68 were in the general population and in people younger than 21. If most people already have these antibodies, Dr. Pallansch said, the test will not help.But if these antibodies are not widespread, then it will be possible to compare levels in children with and without paralysis. If the paralyzed children have a significantly higher percentage of antibodies, enterovirus 68 may well be involved.The antibody test is done, the agency says. Now, researchers at Childrens Hospital Colorado plan to begin looking for enterovirus 68 antibodies in children with limb paralysis.But even finding a link would amount only to good supporting data for a possible cause, said Dr. Dominguez, who is leading the investigation. It could turn out that the virus has nothing to do with their neurological problem.Dr. Benjamin M. Greenberg, a neurologist at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, says he is planning to apply for funding to examine whether the immune system is really to blame. He wants to see if the blood of children with A.F.M. can damage motor neurons in the laboratory.For a study at Johns Hopkins University, researchers are enrolling children who have A.F.M. and siblings who were also probably exposed to enterovirus 68 this fall. The scientists hope to compare the genes of children with A.F.M. to others to see if there are differences.If everybody got enterovirus 68 in a family, but only one child gets paralysis, what is different about that child? said Priya Duggal, the director of the genetic epidemiology program at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who will help lead the study.Are these kids harboring a mutation or a set of mutations that are all the same among kids harboring the disease?At this point, its unclear whether paralysis will continue to affect clusters of children. But that possibility makes deducing its cause a priority.Jack Wernick still needs help to unzip his coat and to carry his lunch tray, but he remains faithful he will recover.

{"body": "SAN FRANCISCO  Silicon Valley companies have sweetened the pot to try to get rid of an embarrassing class-action antitrust suit that accuses them of conspiring against their own employees., ,  and Adobe are offering a joint payment of $415 million to settle the case, according to a person close to the negotiations, up from the $324.5 million they offered in the spring.The case is scheduled to go to trial this spring in San Jose.Lawyers for the 64,000 software engineers who are the class-action plaintiffs have already agreed to the new figure, but that does not automatically end the case. The earlier amount was acceptable to the plaintiffs lawyers, but it was rejected by the judge overseeing the case as inadequate.The suit asserts that the companies had illegal agreements that they would not directly solicit one anothers employees. That limited the engineers mobility and their pay, to the benefit of the companies, the suit said. The case grew out of reported actions by the companies that centered on a period that began in 2005, when Google was ascendant and Apple was trying to defend its turf.Late on Tuesday, the companies filed paperwork with the United States District Court in San Jose saying a deal had been struck and would be announced imminently. The notice did not give a settlement amount.The settlement money is pocket change to the companies, which include some of the worlds wealthiest. If they let the case go to trial, however, it might corrode their image as forward-thinking, worker-friendly benevolent empires.The first settlement  by one of the five named plaintiffs, Michael Devine, who said it was not enough to deter the companies. In an unusual move for a judge in a class-action case, Lucy H. Koh agreed in August that the initial settlement was not within the range of reasonableness. She appeared annoyed that the lawyers for the class were taking the easy way out by settling.The lawyers cut of the settlement is as much as 25 percent. If the case went to trial, they might lose, in which case they would get nothing for years of work. On the other hand, a jury could award the plaintiffs billions. At one point, lawyers for the plaintiffs said the damages were $3 billion, which would be tripled after a guilty verdict.Joseph R. Saveri and Dean Harvey, lawyers for the plaintiffs, did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday night, nor did Google or Adobe. Press officers for Apple and Intel declined to comment.The secret no-poaching deals first came to light after an investigation by the Justice Department that resulted in antitrust complaints against Google, Apple, Intel, Intuit, Adobe, Pixar and Lucasfilm. The companies settled without admitting guilt or paying any fines. Private lawsuits sprung up after, and they were eventually consolidated.Pixar, Lucasfilm and Intuit settled the suit in 2013 before it was approved as a class action, when its legal prospects were much shakier. The companies paid a combined total of $20 million. One longtime employee of Intuit said in an interview that he got $1,000  not enough to pay for the vacation in the Caribbean that he had been hoping for.After the lawyers receive their share, the members of the current class will get a little more: a few thousand dollars.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "DAVID STREITFELD", "title": "Bigger Settlement Said to Be Reached in Silicon Valley Antitrust Case - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/technology/silicon-valley-antitrust-case-settlement-poaching-engineers.html", "date": "JAN. 14, 2015"},
{"body": "Retail sales unexpectedly dropped 0.9 percent in December from the previous month, according to figures  by the Commerce Department, suggesting that falling gas prices and a brighter job market have yet to lift consumer spending.The decrease, far worse than the median 0.1 percent decline that economists had predicted, followed a smaller-than-estimated gain of 0.4 percent for November. The weak spending numbers raise concerns over the 2014 holiday sales season, and could prompt economists to be more pessimistic in their outlook for economic growth this year.But the overall figure reflects a murky picture, because it factors in the slide in gasoline prices. Once gas and automobile sales are excluded, the 0.3 percent fall in the remaining retail sales suggests that consumers were saving the extra dollars instead of spending them. Economists had expected sales excluding gas and autos to jump 0.5 percent.Weighing on consumer sentiment have been sluggish wages, which have failed to pick up despite falling unemployment. Sales in electronics stores, and at clothing and department stores, fell in Decembers broad retreat.Job gains, lower gasoline prices and increases in home and stock prices are positives for household spending. But consumers remain cautious in the wake of the Great Recession, Stuart Hoffman and Gus Faucher, economists at the PNC Financial Services Group, said in a note after the data was released. The new data indicate that the holiday season was an O.K. one, but not great.Experts warned against reading too much into short-term data.The American consumer is fickle, and if we've learned anything over the past few years its that it's dangerous to read a long-term trend based on a couple of months of data, said Chris Donnelly, managing director for retailing at Accenture Strategy.The overall tailwinds the economy has are stronger than the past two years, and those should help drive continued growth, he said.The countrys biggest retail trade group, the National Retail Federation, continued to hit a bullish note on consumers, saying holiday sales  from last year, to $616.1 billion, the strongest growth since 2011. Nonstore holiday sales, an indicator of online purchases, grew 6.8 percent to $101.9 billion, according to estimates the group released Wednesday.There is every reason to believe that we have moved well beyond the days of consumer pessimism and that the trajectory for retailers continues to point up, said Matthew R. Shay, the trade groups chief executive.Another bright spot in the retail data was spending at restaurants and bars, which the Commerce Department said rose 0.8 percent compared with November, suggesting that Americans may be using their gasoline savings to eat out more often, rather than shop.Food and beverage stores, as well as pharmacies and other health and personal care stores, also had higher sales in December. And compared with the same month last year, overall retail spending grew 3.2 percent, the data showed, with gains in all retail categories except department stores and gas stations.Full-year readings of consumer spending painted an even more upbeat picture, with retail sales rising 4 percent in 2014 compared with the previous year, led by an almost 9 percent surge in auto sales. Spending on building materials and home furnishings also logged robust gains, reflecting strong home sales. Shoes and clothing purchases, together with electronics, managed growth of under 3 percent for the year.Its a no-brainer. Its going to be a better year for the consumer in 2015, Paula Campbell Roberts, consumer analyst at Morgan Stanley, said before the datas release. She said that lower gas prices alone had brought consumers a windfall of $50 billion in the fourth quarter, and that they could expect another boost of $80 billion in the first quarter.Thats income thats not having to be devoted to putting gas in our gas tanks and we can spend elsewhere, she said.Its true that wage growth has been sluggish, she added. But we know that with each passing month, labor markets are getting tighter. She said she expected wages in 2015 to grow at an average clip of about 2.5 percent, slightly faster than the 2 percent growth logged last year.Still, the weak reading of year-end sales caused some economists to pare back their consumer spending growth estimates.Chris G. Christopher Jr., director of United States consumer economics at IHS Global Insight, said in a note that he was lowering his forecast for fourth-quarter real consumer spending growth to 3.5 percent from a previous projection of 4.1 percent.But Mr. Christopher also suggested that shoppers had simply spread out their holiday shopping over a longer period of time, as retailers started discounting early and kept the discounts all season long.Retailers were price-discounting early and hard, he said.

That is a decline from the 61 percent of calls answered and average waiting time of 18 minutes in fiscal year 2013.When the wait is too long, the agency offers what it calls a courtesy disconnect  otherwise known as hanging up.Taxpayers who need help are not getting it, and tax compliance is likely to suffer over the longer term if these problems are not quickly and decisively addressed, Ms. Olson wrote.The I.R.S. deals with 200 million Americans, more than three times as many as any other federal agency, the report notes, and as the workload has risen, resources have plummeted. Over the last decade, the agency has fielded 11 percent more individual returns, 18 percent more business returns and a whopping 70 percent more telephone calls.In the last four years, however, its budget has been cut by 17 percent after taking inflation into account, and its work force, now at roughly 83,000, has been reduced by 12,000. Further staffing cuts are expected.This year the agencys job will be even tougher because of new forms, calculations and questions related to provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act that are going into effect.At the same time, the I.R.S. is also trying to rebuild public trust after  that the agency subjected certain tax-exempt groups, including those affiliated with the Tea Party, to especially intense screening.Other organizations have pointed out that cutting the I.R.S.s budget to save money could backfire. An  last year by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an independent research organization, noted: Each additional $1 spent on I.R.S. enforcement yields $6 of additional revenue from collecting taxes owed under current law, according to the Treasury Department. Cuts in I.R.S. enforcement funding are increasing the budget deficit.Among the most serious problems cited in Ms. Olsons report are reductions in some high-volume locations like Manhattan, disproportionate penalties imposed on some taxpayers who did not report  accounts, and a failure to study whether new penalties promote or discourage voluntary compliance. In 12 states and Puerto Rico, there are no permanent appeals officers, delaying the process for months at a time.The report also notes that local outreach and education have essentially disappeared and virtually zero tax returns were prepared at walk-in assistance sites last year. And once tax season passes, the I.R.S. will not answer any tax law questions at all.Ms. Olson repeated her calls to Congress to create a taxpayers bill of rights. The I.R.S. will never be a beloved federal agency, because it is the face of the governments power to tax and collect, Ms. Olson wrote.

We really believe that to advance science and to advance medical care, we wanted to take the next step, she said.Several researchers who have called for more openness in the past said they welcomed the announcements by Johnson & Johnson and the Institute of Medicine, but added that they would be watching closely to see how the initiatives were carried out.Im very enthusiastic about this, and I hope that it will come to fruition in a way thats really meaningful, said Diana Zuckerman, president of the , a nonprofit research and policy group. However, she said, the devil is always in the details on this stuff.She and others said they were disappointed that Johnson & Johnsons agreement does not include most products that are now on the market because it applies only to those approved since the beginning of 2014. She also noted that, because the Food and Drug Administration does not require that all medical devices undergo clinical trials before they are approved, the extent of available data on these devices will be limited. The  for devices that manufacturers argue are updated products that are similar to previously approved devices. The flawed metal-on-metal artificial hips once sold by Johnson & Johnson  which led to serious injuries in patients and  in legal settlements  were approved through the less stringent approval process.It will be fascinating to see what data are actually available, Ms. Zuckerman said.One example of a product that for which data will be newly available is the Thermocool Smarttouch catheter, which is used to help treat patients with a heart arrythmia known as atrial fibrillation. The product was approved in 2014.Dr. Waldstreicher said the company would consider requests to study data for older devices. If theres an important medical question or an important public health question, we would absolutely be open to considering those requests, she said.The announcements on Tuesday follow years of pressure by advocates and researchers to persuade companies to share so-called patient-level clinical trial data, where personally identifiable information has been removed. For years, companies published summaries of the results of their trials in medical journals, but did so selectively and often did not make public studies that did not place their products in a positive light. But in recent years, .I think whats remarkable is that we are now seeing very basic principles of the responsible conduct research  which should best serve society  becoming mainstream by a whole range of organizations, including industry, said Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz, a longtime advocate for data transparency who is director of the Yale University Open Data Access project, which is overseeing the Johnson & Johnson collaboration.In a policy that takes effect this year, the European Medicines Agency, which oversees drug approvals in Europe, will for every newly approved drug, and the American and European pharmaceutical trade groups have issued policies favoring data sharing. But adoption by individual companies has been sporadic, and their policies on making their data public vary widely.The report by the I.O.M. seeks to standardize policies on data sharing, setting out specific timelines for when such information should be made public. It recommends that all sponsors of clinical trials publish detailed trial data within 18 months of completion of the study, or within 30 days of the products approval, whichever comes later. If a company decides to abandon development of a product, it should also make the full results of those trials available within 18 months. It also set out guidelines for how such sharing should occur, recommending that all requests for access be approved by an independent review panel that includes members of the public.An open data movement is really gaining momentum, but still many people are still hesitant, said Dr. Victor Dzau, president of the Institute of Medicine. We need to develop a culture that supports data sharing and we need to provide incentives and develop trust.In a statement, Jeffrey K. Francer, the senior counsel of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said the industry trade group supported the Institute of Medicines efforts and was committed to encouraging responsible data sharing that recognizes the importance of protecting patient privacy, respects the integrity of national regulatory systems, and maintains incentives for continued investment in biopharmaceutical research.Dr. Lisa Schwartz, a professor of medicine the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, said she welcomed the recommendations but noted that while the I.O.M. is influential, it has no power of enforcement.Clearly not everybody is going to listen, she said.

{"body": "WASHINGTON  The House on Wednesday easily passed legislation to ease back some of the banking regulations adopted after the financial crisis, with 29 Democrats shrugging off President Obamas veto threat to join united House Republicans.The bill, which passed 271 to 154, follows two other measures approved in the last month that made changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law, but this one would be the broadest effort to shift course.It would delay by two years a Dodd-Frank mandate that financial firms sell off bundled debt, known as collateralized loan obligations; exempt some  firms from registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission; loosen regulations on derivatives; and allow some small, publicly traded companies to omit historical financial data from their financial filings.Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, called those changes modest clarifications of the Dodd-Frank Act, noting that almost all of the provisions had previously passed the House with bipartisan majorities over the last two years, if not by unanimous agreement.He said the recent Democratic change of heart against the proposals was because the left hand doesnt know what the far left hand is doing.Democrats, led by Mr. Obama and Senator  of Massachusetts, said they intended to draw the line against legislation that further erodes Dodd-Frank.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is helping prevent the kinds of excessive financial risk-taking that caused the worst recession in more than 70 years, left millions of Americans unemployed, and resulted in trillions of dollars in lost wealth, the White Houses official statement of policy said, charging that the House bill would raise risks while benefiting Wall Street and other narrow special interests.For Wall Street lobbyists, Wednesdays vote followed a  they have helped develop: Pass legislation in the House with some Democratic support, then come back on major must-pass bills like spending measures and attach the financial legislation as a noncontroversial rider.Two such provisions have passed within the last month: a measure that repealed Dodd-Franks requirement that banks push the trading of derivatives into subsidiaries that are not eligible for deposit insurance and other government support; and another that exempted some users of derivatives from certain regulations.Advocates for the banking industry argued that there should be little controversy over what they characterized as minor adjustments to Dodd-Frank, but that Democrats were imposing a new litmus test in response to demands from the partys ascendant populist wing.The hyperbole on banking reform might score political points, but the reality is the core of Dodd-Frank is going nowhere, said Tony Fratto, a former Treasury and White House official in the George W. Bush administration, who is a consultant with the financial industry. Most of these minor reforms and technical fixes even had significant Democratic support as recently as four months ago.The Senate has yet to take up the bill, and with Senator Warren leading the charge, it may not be able to muster the 60 votes needed to reach the president.", "publication": "The New York Times", "author": "JONATHAN WEISMAN", "title": "House Passes Measure to Ease Some Dodd-Frank Rules - NYTimes.com", "politicalScore": 0, "posNegScore": 0, "link": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/business/house-passes-measure-to-ease-some-dodd-frank-rules.html", "date": "JAN. 14, 2015"}]
